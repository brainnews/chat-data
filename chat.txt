9/14/17, 11:11 AM - Miles Gilbert: 1b) there is now way the girl in red has an ass nice enough to turn around and look at
9/14/17, 11:11 AM - Miles Gilbert: (different strokes i guess)
9/14/17, 11:12 AM - Michael Lindsay: Does one turn around bc of the ass or the face?
9/14/17, 11:13 AM - William Welles: Can't see a face on someone walking away bro
9/14/17, 11:14 AM - William Welles: I know from personal experience
9/14/17, 11:14 AM - Miles Gilbert: its a good Q tho.. and I'm judging by her face that she doesn't have a nice ass
9/14/17, 11:14 AM - Miles Gilbert: or like a head turning ass
9/14/17, 11:15 AM - Michael Lindsay: I'm saying the thing that makes you turn is you saw her face on the way by not the ass?
9/14/17, 11:15 AM - Miles Gilbert: Ya totally... but i think it would be the hips
9/14/17, 11:15 AM - Miles Gilbert: see dem hips coming towards u... a guy might have to turn and see that ass
9/14/17, 11:16 AM - Miles Gilbert: if i seen that girls face on the street.. i'd be like "ok cute" but im not gonna risk a head turn
9/14/17, 11:16 AM - William Welles: Gotta agree with miles

9/18/17, 10:36 AM - Michael Lindsay: üòè
9/18/17, 10:36 AM - James Ewart: Salt bae
9/18/17, 10:36 AM - William Welles: cover yourself in salt and roll on top of them
9/18/17, 10:42 AM - Miles Gilbert: Jared, u got slugs in your apt?
9/18/17, 10:45 AM - Garrett Ienner: Congrats Miles!!!!
9/18/17, 11:59 AM - Jared O'Connell: No they're outside but I like wills suggestion. Kind of sounds like a spa treatment
9/18/17, 12:19 PM - DL Tashjian: Why do you need to get rid tho
9/18/17, 12:27 PM - Jared O'Connell: Cuz they're taking over
9/18/17, 12:28 PM - DL Tashjian: Are they big giant banana slugs?
9/18/17, 12:29 PM - Jared O'Connell: Some are pretty big. Not as big as bananas tho
9/18/17, 12:29 PM - Jared O'Connell: They're actually kind of beautiful and have a nice pattern
9/18/17, 12:34 PM - Miles Gilbert: What if cultivated a certain area of the exterior to be desirable to a slug to contain them while also being a steward of nature
9/18/17, 12:35 PM - Jared O'Connell: I dunno it's kind of complicated because they love living under the patio boards I think. So they'll always just be there. I'd need to rebuild the whole patio
9/18/17, 12:36 PM - Jared O'Connell: I think I'll just hunt them at night to reduce their numbers
9/18/17, 12:41 PM - James Ewart: If you can't beat them join them
9/18/17, 12:41 PM - Jared O'Connell: Well the problem is I'll just start killing them accidentally then by stepping on them
9/18/17, 12:43 PM - Miles Gilbert: gross
9/18/17, 12:44 PM - DL Tashjian: If they're under the patio just salt it
9/18/17, 12:45 PM - Jared O'Connell: that might work
9/18/17, 12:45 PM - DL Tashjian: Don't have to worry about soil there

10/6/17, 8:54 AM - James Ewart: I'm looking forward to the flashback scene with Shia Labeouf
10/6/17, 8:56 AM - Michael Lindsay: üòÇ
10/6/17, 8:57 AM - William Welles: there better be a Wally Brando appearance in this movie
10/6/17, 10:51 AM - Michael Lindsay: Maybe it's the CBD but I'm feeling really affected and like shit about this country and white people the past 48 hours. I feel like I will have a lot of fighting to do in this life in this country
10/6/17, 12:15 PM - Miles Gilbert: I don't think it's the CBD I think it's reality
10/6/17, 12:16 PM - Michael Lindsay: I am wondering if the CBD is making me more susceptible to emotionality and catastrophic thinking
10/6/17, 12:17 PM - DL Tashjian: Umm 100% it puts you in a relaxed state that allows you to more comfortably embrace your emotions dude
10/6/17, 12:17 PM - DL Tashjian: You're just letting yourself go down a rabbit hole so it gets more extreme
10/6/17, 12:18 PM - DL Tashjian: But I have to agree with miles... It's reality dude
10/6/17, 12:18 PM - Michael Lindsay: The news is definitely a hole but I'm bored and have nothing else to do
10/6/17, 12:19 PM - Miles Gilbert: I think you're just feeling it and that's a good thing
10/6/17, 12:19 PM - Miles Gilbert: I've been more open with emotions this week. Particularly with Yolanda and my work mates. The reduced anxiety allows you to feel more and be more present
10/6/17, 12:20 PM - Miles Gilbert: I'm v into it. Only been a week tho. I want to keep it up
10/6/17, 12:44 PM - Jared O'Connell: Is CBD the cannabis compound that doesn‚Äôt get you high?
10/6/17, 12:44 PM - Jared O'Connell: Cuz I find in general cannabis makes my anxiety and concerns amplified.
10/6/17, 12:47 PM - Miles Gilbert: That's correct jared
10/6/17, 12:48 PM - Miles Gilbert: I've seen chatter on the web about taking some CBD about an hour before smoking weed and that having good results with less weed anxiety
10/6/17, 12:48 PM - Miles Gilbert: Have tried it casually and it is good
10/6/17, 12:49 PM - Jared O'Connell: I‚Äôd try it. Where do you buy CBD. I think I have it in ointment form though in some pain ointment I got in Colorado.
10/6/17, 12:50 PM - Miles Gilbert: I got mine at this shop in Austin. You can buy it online but apparently there's a lot of scams out there selling cheap synthetic stuff
10/6/17, 12:51 PM - Miles Gilbert: this reddit is good https://www.reddit.com/r/CBD/
10/6/17, 12:51 PM - Miles Gilbert: check out the list of shops on the right
10/6/17, 12:51 PM - Miles Gilbert: anyway.. its legal everywhere
10/6/17, 12:52 PM - Jared O'Connell: Oh really. I‚Äôll get some at the smoke shop near me then
10/6/17, 1:28 PM - Garrett Ienner: It is just super mellow then?
10/6/17, 1:28 PM - Garrett Ienner: Like body relax without all the psychoactive effects ?
10/6/17, 1:29 PM - Michael Lindsay: I describe it like a sleeping pill without the drowsiness
10/6/17, 1:29 PM - DL Tashjian: apparently
10/6/17, 2:05 PM - Miles Gilbert: for me, it's helping with a lot of social anxiety from being in a new place. i've been more able to openly embrace my own particular quirks in a way that had become difficult. i know it was anxiety because now that im just doing me again, nothing has changed in the way people treat me.
10/6/17, 2:06 PM - Miles Gilbert: and all of that leads to relaxation
10/6/17, 2:07 PM - Miles Gilbert: and yea, no psychoactive stuff

10/7/17, 10:35 AM - William Welles: It's brutally long and paced completely flat. I found it painful to watch
10/7/17, 10:35 AM - Miles Gilbert: I think IF the hour that was cut out included the fetishization of the objectification of women then it could be saved from being the blight on the earth that it was
10/7/17, 10:35 AM - Miles Gilbert: so painful
10/7/17, 10:35 AM - William Welles: Yeah where were all the hot dude ads that's what I said when I came out
10/7/17, 10:36 AM - Miles Gilbert: haha
10/7/17, 10:36 AM - DL Tashjian: Lol
10/7/17, 10:36 AM - Miles Gilbert: yea.. its like, damn the world sucks and everyones sad, but if ur a straight while male you get to be ryan gosling or harrison ford so its not so bad
10/7/17, 10:36 AM - DL Tashjian: I gotta watch it now no more spoilers
10/7/17, 10:37 AM - Miles Gilbert: i know its simplistic, but i just can't help but think how much more interesting the movie would have been if it were lead by a female
10/7/17, 10:37 AM - Miles Gilbert: it still would have been to long, but at least it wouldn't have been boring as fuck
10/7/17, 10:37 AM - William Welles: Eh. I don't think that would have saved this one personally
10/7/17, 10:37 AM - William Welles: But I agree it's a Hollywood problem in general
10/7/17, 10:38 AM - Miles Gilbert: yea. i'm not saying it would have saved the film, but at least it would be something different
10/7/17, 10:38 AM - Miles Gilbert: and goddamnit can harrison ford just STOP acting
10/7/17, 10:39 AM - William Welles: Stop putting Han Solo in every movie please
10/7/17, 10:39 AM - Miles Gilbert: lol
10/7/17, 10:40 AM - William Welles: I had over a gummy cuz I just kept popping quarters I was so bored
10/7/17, 10:40 AM - Miles Gilbert: i was so high during the movie.. i got a lot of thinking done on other shit that was on my mind

10/7/17, 11:02 PM - Miles Gilbert: Whoa

10/7/17, 11:04 PM - William Welles: He brought up the night like 10 years ago when we ran into him
10/7/17, 11:05 PM - Miles Gilbert: Lolol sounds perf

10/8/17, 4:55 PM - Michael Lindsay: Same I think. Japan is diff
10/8/17, 5:11 PM - Miles Gilbert: üëÑ
10/9/17, 12:12 PM - Ege Soyuer: Did everyone see bad runner yet
10/9/17, 12:26 PM - DL Tashjian: i liked it
10/9/17, 12:27 PM - James Ewart: Not me but I don't mind spoilers
10/9/17, 12:27 PM - DL Tashjian: i'm glad i didn't read all your guys messages until after i saw it tho
10/9/17, 12:27 PM - DL Tashjian: as soon as i saw the rip shred tear happening i waited till i could scroll past tbh
10/9/17, 1:57 PM - Jared O'Connell: i didn't see it yet
10/9/17, 1:57 PM - Jared O'Connell: i will go see it eventually
10/9/17, 1:57 PM - Jared O'Connell: i was pretty excited until you guys started hating on it
10/9/17, 1:57 PM - Jared O'Connell: now i don't really want to see it lol
10/9/17, 1:57 PM - Miles Gilbert: Good
10/9/17, 1:57 PM - Jared O'Connell: but to be honest, the first one is pretty grim on gender politics also
10/9/17, 1:58 PM - Jared O'Connell: so not really a surprise
10/9/17, 1:58 PM - Miles Gilbert: Yea that's part of what makes this one even worse. They had 30 years
10/9/17, 1:58 PM - Michael Lindsay: 30 years in-universe. 35 actual years
10/9/17, 2:00 PM - Jared O'Connell: does it look cool though?
10/9/17, 2:00 PM - Jared O'Connell: because thats the best part of the original
10/9/17, 2:01 PM - Ege Soyuer: It was beautiful, I think it's worth seeing
10/9/17, 2:01 PM - Ege Soyuer: I just had problems w the storytelling
10/9/17, 2:01 PM - Ege Soyuer: I didn't find it as sexist as miles
10/9/17, 2:01 PM - Michael Lindsay: Gonna wholly disagree with Ege
10/9/17, 2:02 PM - Ege Soyuer: I think it could have been re-edited into a great film.
10/9/17, 2:02 PM - Ege Soyuer: Just too much explanation, exposition, pandering to the audience.
10/9/17, 2:03 PM - Ege Soyuer: But visually stunning and brutal and a devastating vision of the future
10/9/17, 2:03 PM - Ege Soyuer: With a clumsily handled story
10/9/17, 2:05 PM - DL Tashjian: i don't agree with the sexist stance. I almost believe that they specifically put that in there as a part of the shitty ass world it takes place in
10/9/17, 2:06 PM - Michael Lindsay: I think the movie had zero creativity or interesting thought, so I don't see that. Sloppy pandering to boomers/men
10/9/17, 2:07 PM - DL Tashjian: this is like people hating the new star wars for not being something completely different
10/9/17, 2:07 PM - Michael Lindsay: Which was valid I think
10/9/17, 2:07 PM - DL Tashjian: i dunno. what did you expect?
10/9/17, 2:07 PM - Michael Lindsay: That movie also happened to be entertaining
10/9/17, 2:08 PM - DL Tashjian: i feel like you guys must think im a jabroni for enjoying this film
10/9/17, 2:09 PM - Ege Soyuer: I enjoyed it but I just rly had to pee for the last hour bc it was TOO LONG and will and mike made me chug a beer before
10/9/17, 2:09 PM - Michael Lindsay: Eh, it's more that I have a philosophical objection to pandering filmmaking
10/9/17, 2:09 PM - Ege Soyuer: It could have been a tight 90 min film
10/9/17, 2:09 PM - Jared O'Connell: well i guess thats also in keeping with the tradition of the original film
10/9/17, 2:09 PM - Michael Lindsay: Disagree
10/9/17, 2:09 PM - Ege Soyuer: Yea but the original u can pause the dvd
10/9/17, 2:09 PM - DL Tashjian: lol
10/9/17, 2:10 PM - Ege Soyuer: Dayvaydayy
10/9/17, 2:11 PM - Miles Gilbert: DL the film makes no effort to explain why or how the world became so shitty and the two white male characters are the only one who get a chance to tell their story. It's extremely white male centered like many films and that is the problem I have with it. At it's most innocent it's a boring film. At it's worst, it reinforces ideas that keep women and people of color in their place and preserves the status quo
10/9/17, 2:11 PM - Ege Soyuer: I would agree it was too white-centric
10/9/17, 2:11 PM - Michael Lindsay: Pointlessly so
10/9/17, 2:12 PM - Miles Gilbert: For the record I think the movie is sexist and racist
10/9/17, 2:12 PM - Miles Gilbert: Both
10/9/17, 2:12 PM - Miles Gilbert: Severely so
10/9/17, 2:12 PM - Ege Soyuer: I agree w the racist bit. The only character of color was a child
Trafficker. For no reason. Could have easily been more diverse.
10/9/17, 2:12 PM - Ege Soyuer: The sexist thing I don't see as much
10/9/17, 2:13 PM - Michael Lindsay: Who said the word slave four times
10/9/17, 2:13 PM - Miles Gilbert: Why is the future of Los Angeles full of white people? What future are white people planning for us?
10/9/17, 2:13 PM - Ege Soyuer: Sexism existing in the plot of movies is not the same as the movie being sexist
10/9/17, 2:13 PM - DL Tashjian: I fully agree with the white wash
10/9/17, 2:13 PM - Miles Gilbert: Not true
10/9/17, 2:13 PM - Michael Lindsay: But in this case I disagree Ege
10/9/17, 2:13 PM - William Welles: The original film la was full of Asian people but all the leads were white
10/9/17, 2:14 PM - Michael Lindsay: The female characters are: a whore, a dialogueless woman that gets her stomach slit for jollies of the white male, a heartless robot assassin that gets brutally murdered
10/9/17, 2:14 PM - Miles Gilbert: If the movie makes no effort to dive into the sexism it uses to create a 'shitty world's it's sexist
10/9/17, 2:15 PM - William Welles: And his boss
10/9/17, 2:15 PM - William Welles: The police chief or whatever
10/9/17, 2:15 PM - Miles Gilbert: Yea the typical cold female boss
10/9/17, 2:15 PM - Michael Lindsay: Oh and a hard ass that... Also gets her stomach slit
10/9/17, 2:15 PM - Miles Gilbert: Nothing new there
10/9/17, 2:15 PM - Miles Gilbert: The female boss has been a problematic female trope for decades
10/9/17, 2:16 PM - William Welles: And I agree w Ege in the abstract that sexism being involved in an narrative and a film being sexist are different things. But that's not to say I think this is the case here
10/9/17, 2:16 PM - Michael Lindsay: There is no more intentionally sex-provoking way to kill a woman than womb-slicing her
10/9/17, 2:16 PM - William Welles: Um knife dick but sure
10/9/17, 2:16 PM - Michael Lindsay: That or strangling
10/9/17, 2:16 PM - Miles Gilbert: Sure will, a movie can deal with sexism. But most use it superficially
10/9/17, 2:17 PM - Ege Soyuer: Ya, I see what you mean
10/9/17, 2:17 PM - Ege Soyuer: I guess it's so ubiquitous I didn't even think of it!
10/9/17, 2:17 PM - Ege Soyuer: I did notice the race thing. Felt clumsy. Amongst other things.
10/9/17, 2:18 PM - William Welles: It would be a more interesting argument if the film was otherwise good I think though.
10/9/17, 2:18 PM - Miles Gilbert: But it's has a fucking 89% on rotten tomatoes
10/9/17, 2:18 PM - Ege Soyuer: I enjoyed bits of it
10/9/17, 2:18 PM - Miles Gilbert: It is good by definition to most
10/9/17, 2:19 PM - William Welles: That's bc film critics don't exist anymore
10/9/17, 2:19 PM - Miles Gilbert: Well
10/9/17, 2:19 PM - William Welles: Just idiots online pandering
10/9/17, 2:19 PM - Miles Gilbert: Yes
10/9/17, 2:19 PM - Miles Gilbert: Still
10/9/17, 2:19 PM - William Welles: Like baby driver. Which I thought was a well directed unique film that I'm glad exists but had weak gender roles
10/9/17, 2:20 PM - Miles Gilbert: And I'm still just as mad about those offensive gender roles
10/9/17, 2:20 PM - Miles Gilbert: That particular one
10/9/17, 2:23 PM - William Welles: Yeah it's a more interesting discussion though bc i found that film not overtly sexist in a vacuum but just using older tropes. And for me not every film has an obligation to carry every social ball forward and the absence of incentive roles isn't always the same as a sexist narrative. And I also see the other side of the argument. BR is less interesting to me as a study bc it objectified women so much and was generally bad in a lot of ways
10/9/17, 2:24 PM - Michael Lindsay: Which film is the first half of that statement about? Br or bd
10/9/17, 2:25 PM - William Welles: First have about bd
10/9/17, 2:27 PM - Miles Gilbert: I just don't see a distinction between using older tropes and being overtly sexist. To me they are the same
10/9/17, 2:30 PM - William Welles: Yeah I understand that. But for me the film was a fable which use simplistic characters and that was across both genders. And in a vacuum I don't find that problematic. But the current state of the broken industry and sexist world make it stand out
10/9/17, 2:31 PM - William Welles: I mean I honestly see both sides. And like I also see a huge lack of creative unique mid budget films so I'm happy for that w bd bc I think the world needs that
10/9/17, 2:31 PM - Miles Gilbert: Right. I love to analyze interesting things in vacuums and baby driver is a good example. I find it difficult to do that now and probably won't be ok with it for the rest of my life
10/9/17, 2:31 PM - Ege Soyuer: Mlz did you like baby driver?
10/9/17, 2:32 PM - Ege Soyuer: Did you find that movie sexist?
10/9/17, 2:32 PM - Miles Gilbert: Yes. And yes.
10/9/17, 2:32 PM - Ege Soyuer: It seems to me they are about the same level of sexist
10/9/17, 2:32 PM - Miles Gilbert: Sexist is sexist
10/9/17, 2:32 PM - Ege Soyuer: I guess blade runner was a bit more.
10/9/17, 2:32 PM - Miles Gilbert: I'm not on levels here
10/9/17, 2:32 PM - Ege Soyuer: 1 out 10
10/9/17, 2:32 PM - Ege Soyuer: How sexy
10/9/17, 2:32 PM - Ege Soyuer: I mean sexist
10/9/17, 2:32 PM - Michael Lindsay: Br was misogynistic IMO
10/9/17, 2:33 PM - William Welles: I don't think baby driver was sexist I think it lacked interesting female roles. For me they aren't quite the same. It didn't advance the ball but wasn't problematic. And I don't feel every film has to... I wish it had but I found br more problematic from a gender pov
10/9/17, 2:37 PM - William Welles: Film is art and individual expression and incredibly hard and we can easily get to the point where we champion shitty work w good gender roles (e.g. glow) over like really interesting work that doesn't move the ball forward (e.g. Young pope to stick e tv)
10/9/17, 2:37 PM - Miles Gilbert: Haha. I really liked glow
10/9/17, 2:38 PM - Miles Gilbert: I see your points will. We'll have to disagree on this one I think
10/9/17, 2:42 PM - William Welles: That's cool. I see your points too and don't even disagree w them... I think it's interesting and complicated all around. And agree w all the problems w representation. I think for you neutral on gender issues is inherently negative where for me it is neutral. Beau travail barely has a female on screen but it still rips me apart and has me balling by the end.... anyway we've probably talked this t death
10/9/17, 2:46 PM - Miles Gilbert: I get u about talking it to death, but We can't stop talking about this overall issue. I'd encourage everyone to view their own everday actions through the lens of gender and how the things we consume affect us and the people around us. Identifying problems within the things we love doesn't mean we can't love them anymore. We just want them to be better.
10/9/17, 2:46 PM - Ege Soyuer: I recently rewatched Independence Day
10/9/17, 2:47 PM - Ege Soyuer: And I wanna love it
10/9/17, 2:47 PM - Ege Soyuer: But man the 90s were brutally sexist
10/9/17, 2:48 PM - William Welles: Fair enough. And I like that nuanced take. But a lot of people don't have that. And that's what worrys me. For me in art we need to find a way to progress while allowing different types of interesting work to exist.
10/9/17, 2:48 PM - Miles Gilbert: Yea. Less white men being the only creators please
10/9/17, 2:48 PM - William Welles: Well sure
10/9/17, 2:49 PM - William Welles: Beau travail is good example. Directed by woman but only men in it
10/9/17, 2:50 PM - Miles Gilbert: Hadn't heard of this movie. Will add it to the list
10/9/17, 2:50 PM - William Welles: And about masculinity and how it destroys men
10/9/17, 2:51 PM - Miles Gilbert: <Media omitted>
10/9/17, 2:52 PM - Miles Gilbert: Christmas is right around the corner william
10/9/17, 2:54 PM - William Welles: I mean the ending of it made me cry more than like any movie i can think of
10/9/17, 2:54 PM - DL Tashjian: well shit now i feel like a jabroni for realz. I'm sorry guys.
10/9/17, 2:54 PM - Ege Soyuer: U ain't a jabroni DL
10/9/17, 2:54 PM - Jared O'Connell: Guys I saw Harvey Weinstein in a panel last week championing women in film. Things are changing (true story)
10/9/17, 2:55 PM - Ege Soyuer: Rly? Pre-allegations or post?
10/9/17, 2:55 PM - Jared O'Connell: Pre NYT
10/9/17, 2:55 PM - Ege Soyuer: Dang
10/9/17, 2:55 PM - Jared O'Connell: Maybe it was 2 weeks ago
10/9/17, 2:55 PM - Jared O'Connell: Well he knew it was coming out so
10/9/17, 2:56 PM - Jared O'Connell: What a üí©
10/9/17, 3:03 PM - Miles Gilbert: DL you don't need to apologise to me. We should be having these conversations and you are free to disagree with any of them. But if you find any of my arguments valid please use your power as a male to call them out when u see them. It can be difficult because few people are able to engage in thoughtful discourse like will and they'll jump to simplistic explanations that 'prove' their side. I've found it to be helpful to listen to more female voices as I try to better myself as a man and begin to undo some of the toxic masculinity that was pumped in to me as a child and teenager and even in my 20s
10/9/17, 3:14 PM - Jared O'Connell: Upvote
10/9/17, 3:15 PM - William Welles: Word
10/9/17, 3:15 PM - William Welles: Understanding the patriarchy destroyed us like it destroyed women is a great starting point
10/9/17, 3:15 PM - William Welles: I mean also. Not in the same manner to the same degree
10/9/17, 3:16 PM - Miles Gilbert: Yeah totally
10/9/17, 3:21 PM - Miles Gilbert: Just make sure to listen 10x more than u speak.
10/9/17, 3:28 PM - Miles Gilbert: I'm about to watch The Mummy (2017). Wish me luck
10/9/17, 3:29 PM - William Welles: You're a glutton for pain
10/9/17, 3:31 PM - William Welles: Right now I'm really interested in passive representation in film. More for queer characters than other things. But I think it's still backwards that any movie right now w a queer protagonist has to explicitly be about their gayness or coming out. Film im writing now has bi male protag but film isn't about that at all it's just in the texture of character and narrative
10/9/17, 3:43 PM - Michael Lindsay: I'm into any representation that has texture of character. Thoughtless/purposeless characterization of either swm or anything else is my enemy

10/10/17, 12:30 PM - Jared O'Connell: I guess Florida/sunbelt life is different but I‚Äôm prettttty sure shorts are never really appropriate at work in even a fairly casual professional environment but if you are definitely going to wear them might as well go super short.

10/12/17, 2:12 PM - James Ewart: Are you gonna dip down to Mahahual for some fresh ceviche?
10/12/17, 2:19 PM - Miles Gilbert: And some smokey treats
10/12/17, 2:20 PM - Miles Gilbert: Not sure Ege. I guess Yolanda's friends are a bit different from us in terms of life stages. But like, everyone is ya feel me?
10/12/17, 2:21 PM - Miles Gilbert: fwiw Yolanda and I are not rushing to the altar. We are committed but focused on other aspects of life at the moment.
10/12/17, 2:29 PM - Jared O'Connell: That‚Äôs cool.
10/12/17, 2:29 PM - Jared O'Connell: Do you guys think if Harvey W wasn‚Äôt a gross slug creature you would find it less gross
10/12/17, 2:30 PM - James Ewart: This year has been so many weddings for me!
10/12/17, 2:30 PM - Michael Lindsay: Not at all
10/12/17, 2:30 PM - Michael Lindsay: Did you listen to the audio?
10/12/17, 2:32 PM - Jared O'Connell: Yeah the audio makes me sick I wasn‚Äôt saying I think so. But it doesn‚Äôt help that he‚Äôs a gross slug creature either.
10/12/17, 2:32 PM - Jared O'Connell: Like I think he‚Äôs the ugliest person ive ever seen
10/12/17, 2:33 PM - Michael Lindsay: I've seen worse and that's your personal opinion. I could see a lot of people fetishizing his aesthetic
10/12/17, 2:33 PM - Jared O'Connell: True

10/16/17, 10:34 PM - Miles Gilbert: will, i really appreciated your post on FB about our roles in the patriarchy and about the need to do better as men. it inspired me to write my own post. thank you
10/16/17, 10:35 PM - Miles Gilbert: (i haven't shared it yet because I think it's too long and I want to edit it)
10/16/17, 10:42 PM - James Ewart: I totally agree, very nicely said Will
10/16/17, 10:43 PM - James Ewart: To the best of my knowledge #metoo started yesterday, or that's when I started seeing it
10/16/17, 10:43 PM - William Welles: I think me too started when one of the women who spoke up about Harvey requested it but I'm not 100% sure. I felt conflicted about writing anything but ultimately did
10/16/17, 10:43 PM - William Welles: Not requested but like suggested
10/16/17, 10:43 PM - William Welles: Sorry I'm stoked
10/16/17, 10:44 PM - William Welles: Stoned
10/16/17, 10:44 PM - Miles Gilbert: same
10/16/17, 10:44 PM - Miles Gilbert: ok.. yea, i was on vacation and came back to twitter today
10/16/17, 10:45 PM - Miles Gilbert: i feel like adding my voice as a male to the conversation feels wrong, but then i think about how amazing it would be if and when a white person speaks out about racism against black people and admits their complicity in it, so in the end i think its necessary
10/16/17, 10:46 PM - Miles Gilbert: but i still feel weird about appropriation of the airwaves
10/16/17, 10:47 PM - Miles Gilbert: i saw a friend (female) on my fb feed propose #ihave for me
10/16/17, 10:47 PM - Miles Gilbert: men
10/16/17, 11:01 PM - William Welles: Yeah I felt conflicted too. Ultimately I saw a lot of female voices online say they wished men would talk about their part in these problems which influenced my decision.
10/16/17, 11:03 PM - William Welles: For the little it's worth I think progress is only possible when their is unity in fighting for these things. And I see too many men remaining disconnected from these issues bc they are in their minds not part of the problem
10/16/17, 11:05 PM - William Welles: But for me I know patriarchy fucked my mind up in a lot of ways and gave me a lot of shame but worse than that it implanted what I came to understand as racist and sexist ways of seeing the world that have to be actively identified and confronted.
10/16/17, 11:37 PM - Miles Gilbert: 100% agree
10/17/17, 10:56 AM - Miles Gilbert: I feel like this is a mike lindsay trivia question waiting to be asked: https://qz.com/1070266/the-name-of-a-country-can-only-really-mean-one-of-four-things/

According to language blogger Paul Anthony Jones, St. Lucia, a third-century woman from Syracuse, is the exception." Too bad St Lucia is too obscure a country make this usable

11/6/17, 2:54 PM - Miles Gilbert: ah cool thanks DL
11/6/17, 2:58 PM - DL Tashjian: Just sayin
11/6/17, 3:05 PM - Jared O'Connell: He was my uncles detective partner in the 70/
11/6/17, 3:05 PM - Jared O'Connell: 70s
11/6/17, 3:05 PM - Jared O'Connell: But he‚Äôs like an insane person
11/6/17, 3:05 PM - Jared O'Connell: I mean I‚Äôm going to vote for DeBlasio for mayor
11/6/17, 3:06 PM - Miles Gilbert: damn. that must have been crazy... nyc in the 70s and ur a detective
11/6/17, 3:08 PM - Jared O'Connell: The big question is the constitutional convention.
11/6/17, 3:08 PM - Jared O'Connell: Which I don‚Äôt really know the answer to
11/6/17, 3:12 PM - Jared O'Connell: Anyone have any thoughts on the Constitutional Convention?
11/6/17, 3:13 PM - Ege Soyuer: nytimes editorial board says no
11/6/17, 3:13 PM - Ege Soyuer: New York daily news says yes
11/6/17, 3:13 PM - Ege Soyuer: That's all I got
11/6/17, 3:13 PM - Jared O'Connell: I guess I‚Äôll read the logic of those editorials
11/6/17, 3:24 PM - DL Tashjian: Jared is that Uncle Sonny?
11/6/17, 3:24 PM - Jared O'Connell: I guess the nytimes is saying basically the risk of the convention resulting in a fucked up new constitution is too high. So even though the constitution is outdated and problematic and should be changed, we can‚Äôt because it‚Äôll be a corrupt process and the risk is too high that it will make things worse.
11/6/17, 3:25 PM - Jared O'Connell: Yeah uncle Sonny
11/6/17, 3:25 PM - DL Tashjian: Nice
11/6/17, 3:27 PM - Miles Gilbert: Damn that's a fucked up reason
11/6/17, 3:27 PM - Jared O'Connell: But like elections are volatile now so makes sense to me
11/6/17, 3:28 PM - Jared O'Connell: And citizens united means moneyed interests can control the process
11/6/17, 3:28 PM - Ege Soyuer: The only counter argument to the nytimes perspective heard so far is "naaaah c'mon you're exaggerating"
11/6/17, 3:29 PM - DL Tashjian: that's insane
11/6/17, 3:36 PM - Jared O'Connell: James Lane looks cool for Public Advocate.
11/6/17, 4:00 PM - Jared O'Connell: Ege are you going pro convention or no
11/6/17, 4:00 PM - Ege Soyuer: I'm goin no
11/6/17, 4:01 PM - Ege Soyuer: Too many crooked ppl in state govt. can't be trusted to not turn over public lands for fracking
11/6/17, 4:06 PM - Miles Gilbert: That's a big one
11/6/17, 4:08 PM - Jared O'Connell: Yeah fracking and like privatize the MTA
11/6/17, 4:08 PM - Jared O'Connell: Rather than actually make the MTA less corrupt
11/6/17, 4:12 PM - William Welles: I think I‚Äôm in favor. The potential upside is just as big as the downside and the state leans left
11/6/17, 4:13 PM - Ege Soyuer: The state legislature does not lean left as far as I know
11/6/17, 4:13 PM - Ege Soyuer: And they would be deciding what goes in
11/6/17, 4:14 PM - Miles Gilbert: I guess the concern is that people won't pay attention to the issues that come up for consideration in the new Constitution
11/6/17, 4:14 PM - William Welles: Don‚Äôt we vote on delegates?
11/6/17, 4:14 PM - William Welles: If we decide to do it?
11/6/17, 4:14 PM - Miles Gilbert: People can still vote on the new ideas in the new Constitution right?
11/6/17, 4:15 PM - William Welles: I didn‚Äôt think state legislature ran it I thought we get to vote on delegates
11/6/17, 4:15 PM - Ege Soyuer: don't know! Gotta do more research
11/6/17, 4:15 PM - Ege Soyuer: Do you hAve any good reading on it
11/6/17, 4:16 PM - Miles Gilbert: The convention, or Con Con, as it‚Äôs known in political circles, is an opportunity to make profound, long-lasting, and much-needed changes to New York‚Äôs outdated state constitution ‚Äî or open a Pandora‚Äôs box that could doom working people forever, depending on whom you ask. I‚Äôve written in¬†favor¬†of holding a¬†convention¬†before, but with the vote fast approaching, it‚Äôs a good time to lay out arguments for and against the measure, so New York voters understand what‚Äôs at stake and what could happen if a majority of them approve rewriting the state constitution.

If a majority statewide votes ‚Äúyes,‚Äù a constitutional convention will be set for the spring of 2019. The convention would be made up of elected delegates, with three provided from each state senate district ‚Äî there are 63 in total ‚Äî plus fifteen statewide. Elections would occur next year, and anyone can run to be a delegate.

These delegates would come together with unlimited abilities to propose amending the constitution in any and all ways they can agree upon. Any amendments approved by delegates would need to be ultimately approved by the voters. This is important to remember: No changes can occur to the constitution without statewide approval at the ballot box.
11/6/17, 4:17 PM - William Welles: Yeah I think the point of it is it‚Äôs a way to make change without the state legislature being involved
11/6/17, 4:17 PM - William Welles: So it‚Äôs a way to break past all the bullshit hurdles and corruption
11/6/17, 4:18 PM - William Welles: Also it seems all the evil people don‚Äôt want it to happen...
11/6/17, 4:18 PM - Ege Soyuer: Ugh here I am blindly trusting the nytimes editorial board but clearly it's more complicated
11/6/17, 4:18 PM - William Welles: And we then get to vote again on each thing the delegates decide
11/6/17, 4:18 PM - William Welles: So it seemingly gives the people far far more power than is the norm
11/6/17, 4:19 PM - Miles Gilbert: Tell ur friends to get out and vote
11/6/17, 4:19 PM - Miles Gilbert: I'd vote Yes. But vote either way. Just vote.
11/6/17, 4:43 PM - Jared O'Connell: I like the idea of voting yes
11/6/17, 4:44 PM - Jared O'Connell: I think the fear is that money will control the delegate voting process. But we can deal with that then, I suppose.
11/6/17, 4:44 PM - Jared O'Connell: But yeah way more money is behind the No vote than Yes vote
11/6/17, 4:45 PM - Jared O'Connell: Which is a weird coalition of powerful leaders from both parties
11/6/17, 4:47 PM - Jared O'Connell: Polling shows a preference for Yes but declining steadily over the past few weeks but the share of undecideds is very high.
11/6/17, 4:54 PM - Miles Gilbert: Get out the vote!!
11/6/17, 4:54 PM - Jared O'Connell: I see a lot of bumper stickers that are anti con con
11/6/17, 4:55 PM - Jared O'Connell: Con con con
11/6/17, 4:56 PM - Miles Gilbert: Wow really
11/6/17, 5:01 PM - Jared O'Connell: Yeah around my neighborhood. I think car owners skew more conservative in my hood, for some reason.
11/6/17, 5:02 PM - Jared O'Connell: But I also think environmentalists are con con con
11/6/17, 5:02 PM - Ege Soyuer: The money being mostly in the no camp makes me wanna vote yes
11/6/17, 5:02 PM - Jared O'Connell: I feel the same way
11/6/17, 5:03 PM - Jared O'Connell: But then I wonder if that‚Äôs a bad reason.
11/6/17, 5:03 PM - Ege Soyuer: But yea I've heard it could be dangerous for the environment bc there will be huge lobbying for accessing public lands for fracking
11/6/17, 5:03 PM - Jared O'Connell: Not just fracking either
11/6/17, 5:04 PM - Jared O'Connell: They‚Äôre also really clever at coming up with ways to make initiatives to open up lands seem benign
11/6/17, 5:05 PM - William Welles: NY State gov is such a cesspool anyway to make change by circumventing them is worth the risk in my book
11/6/17, 5:06 PM - Jared O'Connell: By like tying them to funding for liberal causes or like ‚Äúwe‚Äôll just use 100 acres and then create a new nature preserve that is 10,000 acres‚Äù but it‚Äôs a trick
11/6/17, 5:06 PM - Jared O'Connell: Yeah I think I‚Äôll vote Yes after our convo
11/6/17, 5:12 PM - Miles Gilbert: <Media omitted>
11/6/17, 5:24 PM - Jared O'Connell: <Media omitted>
11/6/17, 5:28 PM - Michael Lindsay: Miles doin chores!!! Yes!
11/6/17, 5:29 PM - Ege Soyuer: Jared :(
11/6/17, 5:29 PM - Ege Soyuer: That's sad
11/6/17, 5:33 PM - Ege Soyuer: Brian Lehrer hosted a debate on WNYC between yes and no. Oxford style debate. Listening now. P. Good.
11/6/17, 5:33 PM - Jared O'Connell: Oooh I‚Äôll check that out
11/6/17, 5:34 PM - Ege Soyuer: It's from oct 16 I think
11/6/17, 5:44 PM - Ege Soyuer: Here's a detail: NAACP, ACLU, planned parenthood are all pushing Nos
11/6/17, 5:44 PM - William Welles: Oh gods now it‚Äôs confusing again
11/6/17, 5:47 PM - Ege Soyuer: As does the civil liberties union
11/6/17, 5:47 PM - William Welles: That‚Äôs the aclu
11/6/17, 5:47 PM - Ege Soyuer: Sorry nyclu
11/6/17, 5:47 PM - Ege Soyuer: Yea same thing
11/6/17, 5:48 PM - William Welles: Hmm
11/6/17, 5:48 PM - Ege Soyuer: https://www.nysut.org/news/2017/june/broad-coalition-announces-opposition-to-a-constitutional-convention
11/6/17, 5:49 PM - Ege Soyuer: but like so does the ny rifle and pistol association
11/6/17, 5:49 PM - Ege Soyuer: this is a confusing one
11/6/17, 5:50 PM - Jared O'Connell: I think basically there is a sort of policial balance of power right now
11/6/17, 5:50 PM - Jared O'Connell: And the con con opens the possibility of changing it
11/6/17, 5:50 PM - Miles Gilbert: Weird
11/6/17, 5:50 PM - Miles Gilbert: And no one wants to tip the scales
11/6/17, 5:50 PM - Jared O'Connell: Well everyone wants to tip the scale
11/6/17, 5:51 PM - Jared O'Connell: But yeah, there‚Äôs a fear it‚Äôll tip the other way
11/6/17, 5:52 PM - Ege Soyuer: a lot of ppl in this debate are talking about citizens united
11/6/17, 5:52 PM - Ege Soyuer: is the reason why this is a bad idea
11/6/17, 5:52 PM - Ege Soyuer: bc koch bros can put unlimited money
11/6/17, 5:52 PM - Ege Soyuer: into pushing their agenda
11/6/17, 5:53 PM - Ege Soyuer: its not gonna be a fair fight
11/6/17, 5:53 PM - Ege Soyuer: is the fear
11/6/17, 5:53 PM - Miles Gilbert: Hmm
11/6/17, 5:53 PM - Jared O'Connell: Right
11/6/17, 5:54 PM - Ege Soyuer: this wnyc debate is interesting bc its progressives on both sides
11/6/17, 5:54 PM - Ege Soyuer: the debate isnt along party lines at all
11/6/17, 5:55 PM - Miles Gilbert: Hrrrrm
11/6/17, 5:55 PM - Jared O'Connell: Yeah, listening now
11/6/17, 5:56 PM - William Welles: Maybe it‚Äôs just how risk averse you are
11/6/17, 5:56 PM - William Welles: Could be big gains at a higher risk. Or preserve the broken status quo and try to incrementally improve within it
11/6/17, 5:57 PM - Ege Soyuer: the other arguemtn for 'no' is low voter turnout and voter apathy... so it will be even more open for manipulation
11/6/17, 6:00 PM - Jared O'Connell: So Ege where do you stand now
11/6/17, 6:00 PM - Jared O'Connell: I‚Äôm really on the fence!!!
11/6/17, 6:00 PM - Ege Soyuer: dude i dont know! me too!
11/6/17, 6:01 PM - Ege Soyuer: im leaning no
11/6/17, 6:01 PM - Ege Soyuer: but im open to yes
11/6/17, 6:04 PM - Jared O'Connell: I like the idea that the delegates may not be co opted yet so they may actually do something to clean up gerrymandering and the general way Albany works
11/6/17, 6:09 PM - Ege Soyuer: both sides are v convincing
11/6/17, 6:09 PM - William Welles: I‚Äôm sticking w yes I think
11/6/17, 6:10 PM - William Welles: I‚Äôm just as scared of these entrenched systems than anything.
11/6/17, 6:10 PM - Miles Gilbert: Is there a lawful neutral chaotic chart for this
11/6/17, 6:10 PM - William Welles: Omg miles
11/6/17, 6:10 PM - Miles Gilbert: Soery
11/6/17, 6:10 PM - Miles Gilbert: Lol
11/6/17, 6:10 PM - William Welles: Yes is def chaotic side
11/6/17, 6:11 PM - Ege Soyuer: i think if it wins
11/6/17, 6:11 PM - Ege Soyuer: we should get really involved in picking delegates
11/6/17, 6:11 PM - William Welles: Yeah
11/6/17, 6:11 PM - Ege Soyuer: slash maybe one of us should run as one
11/6/17, 6:11 PM - William Welles: Luckily if it wins we still get multiple other votes to try to keep it good
11/6/17, 6:13 PM - Ege Soyuer: fyi in the debate the ppl on the No side are all POC's
11/6/17, 6:13 PM - Ege Soyuer: and the ppl on the yes side are all white
11/6/17, 6:13 PM - Ege Soyuer: üòá
11/6/17, 6:13 PM - Miles Gilbert: Hhhhhmmmmnnn
11/6/17, 6:14 PM - Miles Gilbert: Lots of great research ege
11/6/17, 6:14 PM - William Welles: Wonder if it‚Äôs a bad sample group or indicative of something more
11/6/17, 6:14 PM - Miles Gilbert: Why do u write up your findings and do a post?
11/6/17, 6:14 PM - Miles Gilbert: *Don't
11/6/17, 6:14 PM - Ege Soyuer: bc i really cant decide
11/6/17, 6:14 PM - Ege Soyuer: im still listening to the debate
11/6/17, 6:15 PM - Miles Gilbert: But just the data is interesting without a decision
11/6/17, 6:15 PM - Ege Soyuer: they address the race thing in the debate and both sides dismissed it so maybe just small sample size
11/6/17, 6:16 PM - Ege Soyuer: yea but it does come down to risk aversion. the no side is jaded and thinks itll go evil. the yes side is hopeful and thinks its the only way to make real change in the status quo. tough call. both sides are convincing
11/6/17, 6:20 PM - Ege Soyuer: it seems like a lot of the fear about the risks of loss have to do with how badly other, unrelated votes have gone internationally.
11/6/17, 6:20 PM - Ege Soyuer: like brexit and trump and other right wing swings. i feel like if hillary had won, the 'no' voice would be quieter
11/6/17, 6:21 PM - Miles Gilbert: Makes sense
11/6/17, 7:23 PM - Jared O'Connell: FYI I‚Äôm leaning yes
11/6/17, 7:23 PM - Jared O'Connell: So I assume you mean Jared side as in the point Jared made earlier
11/6/17, 7:25 PM - Jared O'Connell: There‚Äôs also the interesting point about how it would influence the movement for a national con con
11/6/17, 7:29 PM - Jared O'Connell: Oh I misread jaded as Jared lol
11/6/17, 7:30 PM - Jared O'Connell: I disagree with jaded/hopeful.
11/6/17, 7:30 PM - Jared O'Connell: But it seems like seeing how the process unfolds if yes succeeds would be a good thing and there will be a 2nd far more consequential vote.
11/6/17, 7:32 PM - Jared O'Connell: Nytimes makes a subtle but important note about delegate selection: Delegates would be chosen according to the contours of the gerrymandered State Senate
11/6/17, 7:33 PM - Jared O'Connell: Also I don‚Äôt think the PoC thing is due to small sample size but says something about the way NY state politics and gerrymandering works
11/6/17, 7:35 PM - Jared O'Connell: I.e white upstate voters have disproportionate representation in state govt
11/6/17, 7:40 PM - Jared O'Connell: Miles what‚Äôs on your ballot tomorrow??
11/6/17, 7:50 PM - Miles Gilbert: Not much. Stuff like whether or not banks can give gifts to people for signing up for new savings accounts and more benefits for disabled vets
11/6/17, 7:50 PM - Miles Gilbert: Small town stuff
11/6/17, 7:55 PM - Jared O'Connell: Are you yes on banks or no
11/6/17, 7:56 PM - Miles Gilbert: Yes because it will help credit Unions compete with big branches
11/6/17, 7:56 PM - Jared O'Connell: Oh that‚Äôs good
11/7/17, 7:52 AM - Jared O'Connell: I voted üôä
11/7/17, 7:55 AM - William Welles: Just realized I have a ct Id... trying to find a bill or something üôÑ
11/7/17, 7:56 AM - Ege Soyuer: Are you sure you need ny id.
11/7/17, 7:57 AM - Ege Soyuer: You may just need valid id
11/7/17, 7:57 AM - Ege Soyuer: Or passport
11/7/17, 7:57 AM - Ege Soyuer: As long as you're reg'd
11/7/17, 8:00 AM - Jared O'Connell: You don‚Äôt need ID at all
11/7/17, 8:00 AM - Jared O'Connell: What is this, Texas? Jk
11/7/17, 8:01 AM - Jared O'Connell: (Bad joke)
11/7/17, 8:01 AM - Jared O'Connell: Unless you‚Äôre not registered in which case, bill should work but you may not even need it. You vote by affidavit or something
11/7/17, 8:02 AM - William Welles: Word I‚Äôll scope it out
11/7/17, 8:02 AM - Ege Soyuer: Jrd I'm registered at my old polling place in Chinatown, Do u know if I can vote in bed stuy if I just bring a bill?
11/7/17, 8:03 AM - Jared O'Connell: You don‚Äôt even need a bill, I don‚Äôt think
11/7/17, 8:03 AM - Jared O'Connell: But you mghtt as well bring it
11/7/17, 8:04 AM - Jared O'Connell: I‚Äôm pretty sure just go to the people at the front and tell them and then you vote by affidavit
11/7/17, 8:04 AM - Ege Soyuer: What is dat like " I swear I live here"
11/7/17, 8:05 AM - Jared O'Connell: Yeah
11/7/17, 8:06 AM - Jared O'Connell: Pretty sure but someone can help you and you can def vote
11/7/17, 8:12 AM - Ege Soyuer: you should still be registered where you voted last time right?
11/7/17, 8:13 AM - James Ewart: Yeah you don't need anything
11/7/17, 8:14 AM - Jared O'Connell: Yes, unless you updated your registration, you‚Äôre still registered there
11/7/17, 8:55 AM - William Welles: My I voted sticker reminds me too much of our selfies last year üò≠
11/7/17, 8:55 AM - Jared O'Connell: Yeah it was triggering going to vote
11/7/17, 8:55 AM - Miles Gilbert: Dude. It will be one year tomorrow
11/7/17, 8:55 AM - Miles Gilbert: I'm shook
11/7/17, 8:56 AM - Ege Soyuer: I've basically been in a state of deep depression since then.
11/7/17, 8:57 AM - Ege Soyuer: Maybe today can mark a new Chapter
11/7/17, 8:57 AM - Ege Soyuer: I can't wait to never hear the words president trump on the radio again
11/7/17, 9:03 AM - William Welles: Vote Jabari for city council if you‚Äôre in the district for It!
11/7/17, 9:03 AM - Jared O'Connell: My city council race had only one candidate ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
11/7/17, 9:03 AM - Jared O'Connell: But he‚Äôs fine, I don‚Äôt hate him
11/7/17, 9:30 AM - Ege Soyuer: Voted by affedavit in my new neighborhood. Thx jared.
11/7/17, 9:30 AM - Ege Soyuer: <Media omitted>
11/7/17, 9:30 AM - Ege Soyuer: Didn't need Id or anything
11/7/17, 9:31 AM - Jared O'Connell: Nice. Was it easy?
11/7/17, 9:31 AM - Ege Soyuer: All the women working the polls called me "baby" the whole time
11/7/17, 9:32 AM - Ege Soyuer: "Alright baby just fill this out"
11/7/17, 9:32 AM - Ege Soyuer: It was great
11/7/17, 9:32 AM - Jared O'Connell: Haha amazing
11/7/17, 9:32 AM - Ege Soyuer: U know this only child loves being coddled like that
11/7/17, 9:33 AM - Jared O'Connell: üòÇ
11/7/17, 9:33 AM - Jared O'Connell: Is it rude to ask if you conconconed or proconconed
11/7/17, 9:34 AM - James Ewart: I'm more curious about the forest proposition...
11/7/17, 9:36 AM - Jared O'Connell: From my research it‚Äôs not actually a scam but a legit thing that upstate towns need
11/7/17, 9:37 AM - Ege Soyuer: I said nay to the forest thing
11/7/17, 9:37 AM - Ege Soyuer: Slippery slope
11/7/17, 9:37 AM - Ege Soyuer: Don't touch those trees
11/7/17, 9:38 AM - Ege Soyuer: Despite feeling like I did my research I still had to guess or leave some things blank
11/7/17, 9:39 AM - Ege Soyuer: Didn't study enough for this multiple choice exam
11/7/17, 9:39 AM - Jared O'Connell: On what, like judges?
11/7/17, 9:39 AM - Ege Soyuer: Yea
11/7/17, 9:39 AM - Jared O'Connell: Yeah I mean the primaries are more important for those
11/7/17, 9:41 AM - Jared O'Connell: It‚Äôs hard to know who to vote for other than party which is why the parties control the judges
11/7/17, 9:48 AM - William Welles: apparently you're supposed to do the democrats under 'working families' party
11/7/17, 9:48 AM - William Welles: also
11/7/17, 9:48 AM - William Welles: my only big gaff was I got excited to see Jabari so I voted for him under green instead of socialist
11/7/17, 9:50 AM - Jared O'Connell: your district judges were diff than mine I think . Mine didn‚Äôt have working families
11/7/17, 9:50 AM - William Welles: the judges no but for the ohter dems
11/7/17, 9:50 AM - Ege Soyuer: Jabari was just your city council right?
11/7/17, 9:50 AM - Jared O'Connell: Oh interesting. Maybe I didn‚Äôt even look far enough to the right.
11/7/17, 9:50 AM - Ege Soyuer: I didn't have him on my ballot
11/7/17, 9:51 AM - William Welles: yeah
11/7/17, 9:51 AM - Jared O'Connell: We‚Äôre all in diff council districts I think.
11/7/17, 9:51 AM - Ege Soyuer: I didn't know who to do for comptroller
11/7/17, 9:52 AM - William Welles: i dont know what a comptroller is
11/7/17, 9:52 AM - William Welles: they troll people on comps?
11/7/17, 9:52 AM - William Welles: you need to be elected to do that?
11/7/17, 9:58 AM - Jared O'Connell: I think they control the checkbook
11/7/17, 10:31 AM - Miles Gilbert: Lol
11/7/17, 10:34 AM - Miles Gilbert: Great political discussion guys üëç
11/7/17, 11:00 AM - Jared O'Connell: What do you think deblasios victory song will be
11/7/17, 11:01 AM - Jared O'Connell: 4 years ago it was Royals by Lorde

11/15/17, 10:18 PM - Michael Lindsay: Art is anything that attracts one's attention without imparting anything of physical value
11/15/17, 10:21 PM - Jared O'Connell: Art can impart physical value
11/15/17, 10:24 PM - James Ewart: Watching this bball game is attracting my attention
11/15/17, 10:25 PM - Jared O'Connell: Bball could arguably qualify as art so mikes def holds true for that.
11/15/17, 10:26 PM - Jared O'Connell: But like fashion or food can be art.
11/15/17, 10:26 PM - James Ewart: Meh, everything is arguably something
11/15/17, 10:26 PM - Jared O'Connell: I mean yeah ur right mikes definition is bullshit üß†
11/15/17, 10:28 PM - Ege Soyuer: <Media omitted>
11/15/17, 10:30 PM - Michael Lindsay: Art is anything created without the intention of imparting physical value
11/15/17, 10:30 PM - Jared O'Connell: no
11/15/17, 10:30 PM - Jared O'Connell: Makeup can be an art
11/15/17, 10:30 PM - Jared O'Connell: Statues are physical
11/15/17, 10:30 PM - Jared O'Connell: What r I talking about
11/15/17, 10:30 PM - Michael Lindsay: Use-value
11/15/17, 10:31 PM - Jared O'Connell: Furniture can be art
11/15/17, 10:31 PM - Michael Lindsay: Craft
11/15/17, 10:32 PM - Jared O'Connell: Disagree firmly

11/15/17, 10:33 PM - Michael Lindsay: Not art
11/15/17, 10:33 PM - Jared O'Connell: Some isn‚Äôt but some is
11/15/17, 10:33 PM - William Welles: A cathedral is a work of art
11/15/17, 10:33 PM - William Welles: And has a use
11/15/17, 10:35 PM - Michael Lindsay: In itself not art. Artistic elements with no use-value on their own
11/15/17, 10:35 PM - William Welles: Or any reliquary you ding bat
11/15/17, 10:36 PM - William Welles: Or an illuminated manuscript
11/15/17, 10:36 PM - Jared O'Connell: No. It‚Äôs art to design things that both account for aesthetic form and functional form.
11/15/17, 10:36 PM - William Welles: James blue chair is art and a great place to perch a tired set of buns

11/15/17, 10:49 PM - Jared O'Connell: MichAel I think I understand your point but I think it‚Äôs hard to parse elements of design like that. You have to assess objects in their entirety.
11/15/17, 10:49 PM - Jared O'Connell: Gnight ü§´
11/16/17, 7:30 AM - Garrett Ienner: I'm more with Mike on this one. Will be a fun argument !

11/17/17, 1:21 PM - Michael Lindsay: Does anyone have a cosmic brain meme for anxiety sucks, anxiety is your brain telling you something is wrong, etc. I want to see cosmic level so I can skip to it
11/17/17, 1:21 PM - William Welles: but isnt the joke that cosmic level is always idiotic?
11/17/17, 1:24 PM - Michael Lindsay: Don't care. I'm stuck at too low level. I just said anxiety to myself for 10 minutes out loud before the doorbell rang
11/17/17, 1:26 PM - Miles Gilbert: haven't seen a meme about that, but i feel like it exists
11/17/17, 1:27 PM - Michael Lindsay: I'm a meme

11/28/17, 8:22 AM - Jared O'Connell: At Paris
11/28/17, 8:22 AM - Jared O'Connell: Which is a sort of cool place if you‚Äôve never been
11/28/17, 8:26 AM - Miles Gilbert: Ah I love the Paris theater
11/28/17, 8:30 AM - Jared O'Connell: I loved the movie as expected
11/28/17, 8:31 AM - Jared O'Connell: Some good performances

11/28/17, 8:56 AM - Jared O'Connell: Single screen built in like the 40s I think
11/28/17, 8:57 AM - James Ewart: Definitely gonna see The Greatest Showman there
11/28/17, 1:01 PM - DL Tashjian: https://www.gamespot.com/amp-articles/luke-skywalker-actor-mark-hamill-on-the-classic-st/1100-6455229/
11/28/17, 1:09 PM - Michael Lindsay: Yo that's interesting
11/28/17, 1:14 PM - Jared O'Connell: very meat is murder
11/28/17, 1:17 PM - Michael Lindsay: I canonized Luke's behavior before I watched things with critical analysis. I see what he's saying very much and I wonder if kirshner would counter that this was pre-yoda therefore necessary to show unwoke yet powerful Luke
11/28/17, 1:30 PM - DL Tashjian: see thats why i found it interesting
11/28/17, 1:30 PM - DL Tashjian: the womp rats makes total sense but the snow monster...
11/28/17, 1:31 PM - DL Tashjian: it is good representation that he had made a decision to follow a path and was basically treading water with obi wan being gone
11/28/17, 1:31 PM - Miles Gilbert: i remember that scene feeling icky to me as a kid
11/28/17, 1:31 PM - DL Tashjian: i just remember being so stoked when he got the saber
11/28/17, 1:31 PM - Jared O'Connell: i thought the snow monster was evil, as a kid. like the T-rex in Jurassic Park.
11/28/17, 1:31 PM - DL Tashjian: so tense
11/28/17, 1:31 PM - DL Tashjian: me too
11/28/17, 1:31 PM - Michael Lindsay: Me too
11/28/17, 1:32 PM - Jared O'Connell: But it's a good point that it isn't evil.
11/28/17, 1:32 PM - Jared O'Connell: Cuz the T-rex was only evil because it was a mistake for humans to try to create one on their own.
11/28/17, 1:33 PM - Jared O'Connell: Wasn't that scene hastily arranged bc of his car accident?
11/28/17, 1:33 PM - Michael Lindsay: Anything tryna get the protag seemed evil to me as a kid
11/28/17, 1:34 PM - William Welles: Yeah as a kid I was like oh good he escaped the scary monster and didn‚Äôt think any more about it
11/28/17, 1:34 PM - William Welles: Also actors rarely have any worthwhile insight into decisions made...
11/28/17, 1:35 PM - Jared O'Connell: unless you're daniel day lewis: https://www.wmagazine.com/story/exclusive-daniel-day-lewis-giving-up-acting-phantom-thread
11/28/17, 1:36 PM - William Welles: Lol I was actually going to write that

11/28/17, 1:37 PM - Miles Gilbert: dats dope
11/28/17, 1:38 PM - William Welles: The q and a moderator was this horrible giggling muppet boy so it was a bit of a wasted opportunity
11/28/17, 1:39 PM - Michael Lindsay: Standard
11/28/17, 1:39 PM - William Welles: The only time they actually started discussing something interesting he cut them off with another stupid question
11/28/17, 1:39 PM - William Welles: This one was next level though
11/28/17, 1:41 PM - Michael Lindsay: What happens when a generation of bloggers gets no training on critical responsibility and thinks writing is a good excuse to get in close proximity to famous people
11/28/17, 1:42 PM - Miles Gilbert: dannnnggg
11/28/17, 1:42 PM - William Welles: He also fit into a trend where he‚Äôd ask men about their craft and women about like what their characters felt in specific scenes
11/28/17, 1:43 PM - William Welles: To which the only answer is to describe the scene...
11/28/17, 1:43 PM - William Welles: Pretty bad
11/28/17, 1:43 PM - Michael Lindsay: What woman was up there?
11/28/17, 1:43 PM - Jared O'Connell: what is the moderator's name
11/28/17, 1:43 PM - Jared O'Connell: i want to check out his twitter
11/28/17, 1:43 PM - William Welles: Like fat giggly curling haired sycophant?
11/28/17, 1:43 PM - Jared O'Connell: lololol
11/28/17, 1:44 PM - William Welles: I don‚Äôt actually know how to find his name
11/28/17, 1:45 PM - William Welles: He‚Äôs probably someone‚Äôs stupid nephew who received a thrown bone
11/28/17, 1:45 PM - William Welles: Bc the bigger screening was right after
11/28/17, 1:49 PM - Jared O'Connell: are you all going to CMBYN tonight?
11/28/17, 1:51 PM - William Welles: No on thor‚Äôs day
11/28/17, 1:58 PM - Jared O'Connell: oh its actually named for Thor. INteresting. never knew that. etymology plays a part in the movie too. Interesting!!

11/28/17, 9:32 PM - Jared O'Connell: Which one
11/28/17, 9:33 PM - DL Tashjian: Love the jackal
11/28/17, 9:37 PM - James Ewart: I could watch jack black saying 2000 mile zoom lens forever
11/28/17, 9:38 PM - William Welles: I think that‚Äôs pretty achievable I bet the dvd is reasonably priced
11/28/17, 9:41 PM - Ege Soyuer: This scene traumatized me the first time I saw it
11/28/17, 9:41 PM - Ege Soyuer: The sheer brutality
11/28/17, 9:41 PM - Ege Soyuer: Very unsettling
11/28/17, 10:05 PM - Jared O'Connell: I thought you meant you wanted to emulate BWs ‚Äúdon‚Äôt touch that
11/29/17, 8:54 AM - William Welles: Have any of you ever got a ‚Äòservice battery‚Äô warning on your Mac?
11/29/17, 8:54 AM - William Welles: I think my battery died and I don‚Äôt wanna pay to fix it üò´

11/29/17, 8:56 AM - William Welles: macbook pro retina from 2012
11/29/17, 8:56 AM - William Welles: it shows up when you click the battery icon
11/29/17, 8:57 AM - William Welles: noticed bc my battery drained in like an hour last night then i saw warning
11/29/17, 8:57 AM - Jared O'Connell: 5 yr old battery is old
11/29/17, 8:57 AM - William Welles: daaaaaang
11/29/17, 8:57 AM - Jared O'Connell: They‚Äôre meant to last like 3 years
11/29/17, 8:57 AM - Jared O'Connell: But some had recalls so you could see if apple has a replacement plan
11/29/17, 8:58 AM - Jared O'Connell: But they generally have a limited number of cycles
11/29/17, 8:58 AM - William Welles: so just call apple and see whats up - at this point is it worth replacing or should I just get a new computer b/c everything will start to die
11/29/17, 8:58 AM - William Welles: yeah apple says 1000, mine is at 780
11/29/17, 9:00 AM - Jared O'Connell: That sucks. You could probably buy a 3rd party battery kit and watch a YouTube video to install it
11/29/17, 9:01 AM - William Welles: yeah
11/29/17, 9:01 AM - DL Tashjian: Mac doesn't really have anything decent rn

11/29/17, 9:17 PM - Miles Gilbert: Movie marathon idea (lemme know if someone's already done it): a series of films with lead characters that were the same age as us (+/-1 year or so) when the movie came out. Since we are all around the same age, it could be a cool study of the roles that may have influenced our lives.

11/30/17, 10:45 AM - Jared O'Connell: I think there is less concern among congressional democrats v. Health bill etc bc Rs HAVE to pass this bill or they‚Äôll lose their donors, but it‚Äôs going to be so unpopular that dems should be able to campaign against it in 18 and 20
11/30/17, 10:46 AM - Jared O'Connell: The problem is the bill does provide short term tax reductions for most ppl
11/30/17, 10:46 AM - William Welles: No way we get rid of the lower corporate tax
11/30/17, 10:46 AM - Jared O'Connell: Until about 2020
11/30/17, 10:46 AM - William Welles: That‚Äôll be around forever and then they‚Äôll just use the money to buy more senators
11/30/17, 10:46 AM - Jared O'Connell: Eh lower Corp tax is more about the loopholes etc than about the actual tax rate
11/30/17, 10:49 AM - Jared O'Connell: But yeah keep calling it‚Äôs better if it doesn‚Äôt pass

12/7/17, 7:24 PM - Jared O'Connell: imagine.
12/8/17, 9:48 AM - William Welles: ew that would have been so weird
12/8/17, 10:40 AM - Jared O'Connell: Yeah would‚Äôve been bizarre
12/8/17, 10:40 AM - Jared O'Connell: Did you like it
12/8/17, 10:52 AM - William Welles: yeah I enjoyed the film - I liked it a lot for what it didn't do, i.e. a queer movie where shame is not a major driving emotion, where parents judgement is not a major problem. I thought it was mostly nicely shot though there were some weird like 1 second jump cuts that I found distracting. it felt akin to those classic summer romance movies where not much actually happens but its about a vibe and a feeling which it did well
12/8/17, 10:52 AM - William Welles: mostly just made me jealous that people could have parents that good lol
12/8/17, 10:53 AM - Jared O'Connell: Yeah had the same thoughts
12/8/17, 10:53 AM - William Welles: like a queer my summer with monika which is fun
12/8/17, 10:56 AM - William Welles: all in all Id put it on par with ladybird - as like very solid films that aren't doing much exciting cinematically but are presenting a world well, are well written, and stand our more in terms character and writing than cinematic directing
12/8/17, 10:56 AM - Jared O'Connell: The stuhlbarg scene towards the end is pretty nuts
12/8/17, 10:56 AM - Jared O'Connell: Still need to see ladybird
12/8/17, 10:57 AM - William Welles: yeah that got me choked up for sure
12/8/17, 10:57 AM - William Welles: he was supposed to be in my film but the dates didnt work üò≠
12/8/17, 10:57 AM - William Welles: he was probably shooting this or something lol
12/8/17, 10:59 AM - Jared O'Connell: Wow üò≤
12/8/17, 11:00 AM - William Welles: ladybird is worth seeing for sure
12/8/17, 11:00 AM - Jared O'Connell: Yeah ganna see it soon hopefully
12/8/17, 11:00 AM - William Welles: i'm mostly excited about I, Tonya now which I really wanted to see last night but my back was fucked
12/8/17, 11:03 AM - Jared O'Connell: Oh is that out? What happened to your back?
12/8/17, 11:04 AM - William Welles: yeah It just came out at angelika, idk I tweaked it or something I was up on blocks all day yesterda

12/11/17, 5:08 PM - Jared O'Connell: Me too! I watched force awakens a few days ago and I thought it was better than I remember
12/11/17, 5:08 PM - DL Tashjian: can we instate a no spoilers until everyone on bro chat has seen it
12/11/17, 5:08 PM - Ege Soyuer: It‚Äôs basically all I‚Äôve got to do this year
12/11/17, 5:08 PM - DL Tashjian: I watched all three of the originals and am gonna watch force awakens tomorrow night
12/11/17, 5:08 PM - DL Tashjian: unsurprisingly had a lot of issues with rotj
12/11/17, 5:09 PM - DL Tashjian: and the "there is another..." line from Empire
12/11/17, 5:09 PM - DL Tashjian: has it been discussed who the other was
12/11/17, 5:10 PM - Ege Soyuer: Wasn‚Äôt it Leia
12/11/17, 5:10 PM - DL Tashjian: i think that's what it implied but
12/11/17, 5:13 PM - Jared O'Connell: the plot hole there has to do with the prequels though, right?
12/11/17, 5:16 PM - Jared O'Connell: like, OT that isn't a problem and the other is leia
12/11/17, 5:16 PM - Garrett Ienner: Well in hindsight it was certainly leia
12/11/17, 5:16 PM - Garrett Ienner: Even though when they wrote the script it could have been undecided
12/11/17, 5:17 PM - Jared O'Connell: Well prequels make that not work. Because Obi-wan would definitely have known about Leia.
12/11/17, 5:17 PM - Garrett Ienner: The prequels basically out of the canon at this point I feel
12/11/17, 5:17 PM - Garrett Ienner: lol
12/11/17, 5:17 PM - DL Tashjian: Jared is right tho
12/11/17, 5:18 PM - DL Tashjian: i think prequels are non-canon
12/11/17, 5:18 PM - Garrett Ienner: Well maybe yoda and obi wan just had a difference of opinion üòâ
12/11/17, 5:18 PM - Jared O'Connell: i mean there are endless prequel plot holes
12/11/17, 5:18 PM - DL Tashjian: they are strictly hypothetical
12/11/17, 5:18 PM - Garrett Ienner: Lol
12/11/17, 5:18 PM - Jared O'Connell: obi-wan would've recognized those droids
12/11/17, 5:18 PM - DL Tashjian: he does
12/11/17, 5:18 PM - Garrett Ienner: Maybe obi was sexist
12/11/17, 5:18 PM - DL Tashjian: "I don't seem to remember ever 'owning' a droid"
12/11/17, 5:19 PM - DL Tashjian: he knew who they were
12/11/17, 5:19 PM - Jared O'Connell: fair enough
12/11/17, 5:19 PM - DL Tashjian: Plus. that old wizard had been living in sand people territory for too long
12/11/17, 5:19 PM - DL Tashjian: he's crazy
12/11/17, 5:20 PM - Jared O'Connell: I think "there is another" comment was just a set up for Luke and Leia being siblings and Lucas hadn't really thought much further about it than that.
12/11/17, 5:21 PM - DL Tashjian: <Media omitted>
12/11/17, 5:22 PM - William Welles: Yeah it just meant there is another Skywalker(leia)
12/11/17, 5:23 PM - Jared O'Connell: I don't think Lucas realized that Leia was Darth Vader's daughter when he made A New Hope
12/11/17, 5:23 PM - Jared O'Connell: like, I think the idea came later.

12/11/17, 5:24 PM - William Welles: But no he didn‚Äôt decide they were siblings yet for sure
12/11/17, 5:24 PM - DL Tashjian: you have to visit this place:
12/11/17, 5:24 PM - DL Tashjian: https://saharalounge.com/
12/11/17, 5:24 PM - DL Tashjian: Also, who's idea was it to make the force users haves telepathic and telekinetic powers

12/11/17, 5:28 PM - William Welles: All these years later jar jar is the best part of the prequels
12/11/17, 5:28 PM - Jared O'Connell: if you watch it thinking he's evil sith, it makes more sense
12/11/17, 5:28 PM - DL Tashjian: i love that
12/11/17, 5:28 PM - DL Tashjian: i mean he
12/11/17, 5:28 PM - DL Tashjian: he is the only part ppl talk about anymore
12/11/17, 5:28 PM - William Welles: The prequels only got worse as Lucas got scared and cut him out
12/11/17, 5:28 PM - Jared O'Connell: yeah
12/11/17, 5:29 PM - William Welles: Bc everything else was SO lifeless that you could really feel the emptiness after that
12/11/17, 5:29 PM - Jared O'Connell: i agree with that completely
12/11/17, 5:29 PM - Michael Lindsay: you people disgust me
12/11/17, 5:29 PM - Jared O'Connell: why
12/11/17, 5:29 PM - William Welles: Damn thought I was gunna get a lot of push back on that hot take

12/11/17, 5:30 PM - William Welles: Pretty proud of everyone cept that dincompoop Michael
12/11/17, 5:30 PM - Jared O'Connell: but response was so intensely negative they had to change course
12/11/17, 5:30 PM - William Welles: For sure
12/11/17, 5:30 PM - Jared O'Connell: first CGI character, right? it was like a big deal
12/11/17, 5:32 PM - Jared O'Connell: or one of the first
12/11/17, 5:33 PM - Ege Soyuer: I can rly relate to jar jar
12/11/17, 5:33 PM - Ege Soyuer: He was the only character that was believable
12/11/17, 5:33 PM - Jared O'Connell: he was ahead of his time.
12/11/17, 5:34 PM - Jared O'Connell: i would be extremely happy if Snoke was Jar Jar
12/11/17, 5:34 PM - William Welles: Won‚Äôt happen but I‚Äôd be down
12/11/17, 5:34 PM - Ege Soyuer: Even though he feels like some poorly done racial stereotype
12/11/17, 5:35 PM - William Welles: The fate of jar jar in Disney canon is he gets banished from Naboo and ends up being a beggar slash street performer that everyone hates
12/11/17, 5:35 PM - William Welles: Look it up
12/11/17, 5:35 PM - William Welles: Well Ege that includes every alien in episode 1

12/11/17, 5:38 PM - William Welles: Someone needs to pitch a Star Wars story film that is like a raging thunder type racing movie about the pod racing circuit
12/11/17, 5:38 PM - William Welles: Holy shit I‚Äôm a genius
12/11/17, 5:38 PM - William Welles: Michael is getting furious bc he thinks revenge of the sith is legit good
12/11/17, 5:39 PM - Jared O'Connell: haha, well its better than attack of the clones
12/11/17, 5:39 PM - William Welles: And another that is a civil rights movie about droids

12/11/17, 5:40 PM - DL Tashjian: {metal bending}
12/11/17, 5:40 PM - William Welles: ‚ÄúI have the high ground you cannot win‚Äù ‚Äúthat depends on your definition!‚Äù
12/11/17, 5:40 PM - DL Tashjian: Or the birth scene when she names them and it's like an assembly line of babies
12/11/17, 5:40 PM - Michael Lindsay: guess youve never been really hurt inyor life lucky you
12/11/17, 5:41 PM - William Welles: @12039186666 lolololol
12/11/17, 5:41 PM - DL Tashjian: hahahahaha why are you dissin me ML I was partially defendin u
12/11/17, 5:41 PM - William Welles: The real hurt was when watto gets fleeced by Quaoi gon on a loaded force dice roll

12/11/17, 5:42 PM - Ege Soyuer: Woa
12/11/17, 5:42 PM - William Welles: That‚Äôs hurt
12/11/17, 5:42 PM - Ege Soyuer: I like the quaigon theory
12/11/17, 5:42 PM - William Welles: Cept he‚Äôs dead üíÄ
12/11/17, 5:42 PM - Ege Soyuer: Sorta looks like Liam nielsons
12/11/17, 5:43 PM - Jared O'Connell: i mean you are adding to the argument that the jedi are the villains in the overall story arc
12/11/17, 5:43 PM - William Welles: It‚Äôll probably just be like a boba fett clone bc everything in Star Wars ends up being a boba fett clone
12/11/17, 5:43 PM - William Welles: ‚ÄúIn my opinion it is the Jedi who are evil‚Äù
12/11/17, 5:44 PM - Jared O'Connell: but like, he's right.
12/11/17, 5:44 PM - William Welles: Totes
12/11/17, 5:44 PM - Ege Soyuer: This is some alt right opinions
12/11/17, 5:44 PM - William Welles: Jedi deserves to fall
12/11/17, 5:44 PM - Ege Soyuer: Happening right here
12/11/17, 5:44 PM - Jared O'Connell: they literally rule over everyone in their ivory tower
12/11/17, 5:44 PM - William Welles: Aloof to the plight of the common man
12/11/17, 5:44 PM - Garrett Ienner: Guys I'm happy to do force awakens Wednesday
12/11/17, 5:44 PM - Ege Soyuer: That‚Äôs what the alt right would say
12/11/17, 5:45 PM - Garrett Ienner: But don't think I can do ep 1
12/11/17, 5:45 PM - Garrett Ienner: Even though a part of me likes it more than FA
12/11/17, 5:45 PM - William Welles: I didn‚Äôt vote for any Jedi
12/11/17, 5:45 PM - William Welles: Who made them king
12/11/17, 5:46 PM - Michael Lindsay: lol
12/11/17, 5:46 PM - Jared O'Connell: i mean i guess maybe the jedi are actually like the FBI / mueller probe.
12/11/17, 5:46 PM - Jared O'Connell: well let's hope not.
12/11/17, 5:47 PM - William Welles: I mean they raised an army by like randomly buying a million boba fetts that like they know an evil person ordered
12/11/17, 5:47 PM - William Welles: Doesn‚Äôt seem like there‚Äôs a lot of critical thinking
12/11/17, 5:48 PM - William Welles: Also if they‚Äôre so good how do they excuse using clones as an eternal soldier class w no rights or choice
12/11/17, 5:49 PM - Garrett Ienner: Maybe the clones aren't conscious at all
12/11/17, 5:49 PM - Garrett Ienner: They are zombie essentially
12/11/17, 5:50 PM - William Welles: Except we see them use critical tactical thinking
12/11/17, 5:50 PM - William Welles: I think it‚Äôs pretty fucked up
12/11/17, 5:50 PM - Garrett Ienner: That's how they appear
12/11/17, 5:50 PM - William Welles: Just as bad as the republics refusal to give droids rights
12/11/17, 5:50 PM - William Welles: Legalized slavery I say
12/11/17, 5:50 PM - Garrett Ienner: Lol
12/11/17, 6:38 PM - Jared O'Connell: Good time ending this convo. Was worried I‚Äôd miss out when I had to leave for my company holiday party.

12/13/17, 12:33 PM - William Welles: Imagine eating soup
12/13/17, 12:34 PM - William Welles: It runs off the spoon and down your beard in salty rivulets
12/13/17, 12:34 PM - Ege Soyuer: Soup is flavored mud
12/13/17, 12:35 PM - William Welles: Exactly! Ege gets me
12/13/17, 12:38 PM - Michael Lindsay: Ege üëèüëè
12/13/17, 12:44 PM - Garrett Ienner: What about Chili Will? That's kinda a soup
12/13/17, 12:44 PM - Garrett Ienner: Still conceptually disgusting
12/13/17, 12:44 PM - Garrett Ienner: ?
12/13/17, 12:45 PM - William Welles: It‚Äôs disgustingness scales w it‚Äôs thickness
12/13/17, 12:45 PM - William Welles: If it‚Äôs thick enough it isn‚Äôt as gross
12/13/17, 12:50 PM - Garrett Ienner: lol
12/13/17, 12:51 PM - Garrett Ienner: I mean I guess a meat broth is basically hot bone juice
12/13/17, 12:52 PM - William Welles: Thin white soups are the grossest
12/13/17, 12:52 PM - William Welles: Tomato soup at least it‚Äôs like oh I‚Äôm just drinking smushed tomatoes
12/13/17, 12:52 PM - William Welles: I think spoon size is a factor. Deeper the spoon w less run off is preferable
12/13/17, 12:53 PM - Garrett Ienner: What about the medieval times spoon/bowl
12/13/17, 12:53 PM - Garrett Ienner: ?
12/13/17, 12:54 PM - William Welles: I think that made soup less disgusting.
12/13/17, 12:54 PM - William Welles: It kind of pushed it both ways but tricky to figure out the net change
12/13/17, 1:09 PM - Miles Gilbert: Did u guys use utensils at medieval times
12/13/17, 1:09 PM - William Welles: only anais' friend who smuggle utensils in

12/13/17, 1:16 PM - Jared O'Connell: Although soup dumplings r better
12/13/17, 1:19 PM - James Ewart: I love a good NE clam chowder
12/13/17, 1:19 PM - Michael Lindsay: Something can be both good and conceptually disgusting. Like anything involving semen
12/13/17, 1:19 PM - Miles Gilbert: Chowder is good
12/13/17, 1:19 PM - William Welles: Soup dumplings are amazing but unbelievably disgusting
12/13/17, 1:19 PM - Miles Gilbert: Mmmm
12/13/17, 1:20 PM - William Welles: You‚Äôre tearing holes in little dough balls to suck the oil out. Sounds more like a date w Apolon than a meal
12/13/17, 1:20 PM - Jared O'Connell: Mmmmmm
12/13/17, 1:21 PM - Jared O'Connell: Most food is conceptually disgusting except raw vegetables.
12/13/17, 1:21 PM - William Welles: True
12/13/17, 1:21 PM - William Welles: But soup is near the top of the list
12/13/17, 1:23 PM - Jared O'Connell: Lol what about anything with ground meat
12/13/17, 1:23 PM - Jared O'Connell: Or blue cheese
12/13/17, 1:24 PM - William Welles: Yeah but I‚Äôm not talking about like when you really dig into it
12/13/17, 1:24 PM - Jared O'Connell: Oh yeah
12/13/17, 1:24 PM - William Welles: Like chicken nuggets are less disgusting than soup. Even though the process of making them is gross
12/13/17, 1:24 PM - Jared O'Connell: True they‚Äôre like perfect food shape
12/13/17, 2:12 PM - James Ewart: That pink slime
12/13/17, 2:32 PM - Garrett Ienner: Or conceivably, "deep fried chicken p√¢t√©"
12/13/17, 2:33 PM - Garrett Ienner: Which sounds delicious
12/13/17, 2:33 PM - Jared O'Connell: haha

1/1/18, 3:16 PM - Garrett Ienner: Hahahah

1/2/18, 9:00 AM - Garrett Ienner: Don't think I'd seen it since the theaters
1/2/18, 9:00 AM - William Welles: half blood is amazing
1/2/18, 9:00 AM - William Welles: worst book best movie
1/2/18, 9:00 AM - William Welles: cept 3 is actually probably better but still
1/2/18, 9:01 AM - Garrett Ienner: Hahaha
1/2/18, 9:01 AM - Garrett Ienner: I was blown away
1/2/18, 9:01 AM - William Welles: its just them getting fucked up on butter beer and flirting
1/2/18, 9:01 AM - William Welles: its so good
1/2/18, 9:01 AM - Garrett Ienner: And they completely nailed teenage romance
1/2/18, 9:01 AM - Garrett Ienner: Like better than a John Hughes movie
1/2/18, 9:01 AM - William Welles: yeah lol
1/2/18, 9:01 AM - Garrett Ienner: The whole thing is about drugs and fucking
1/2/18, 9:01 AM - William Welles: I know its great
1/2/18, 9:01 AM - Garrett Ienner: Butter beer, potions, and brandy
1/2/18, 9:02 AM - William Welles: and slughorn
1/2/18, 9:02 AM - Garrett Ienner: Even the first scene where Harry is about to bang that hot waitress
1/2/18, 9:02 AM - William Welles: omg yeah
1/2/18, 9:02 AM - William Welles: 5 is really strong too but mostly bc the whole ministry sequence is stunning - the rest of the movie is fine but building up to that
1/2/18, 9:03 AM - William Welles: its a bummer 4 is so fucking bad or you'd have 3,5,6 all good in a row
1/2/18, 9:03 AM - Garrett Ienner: And when dumbldore just created a fire bomb in the cave
1/2/18, 9:03 AM - Garrett Ienner: Yeah I don't need to see Robert Pattinson

1/2/18, 9:04 AM - William Welles: @12039186666 is gunna drop in be like "yeah I re-thought it chamber of secrets is the best HP"
1/2/18, 9:04 AM - Garrett Ienner: Chamber sucks

1/2/18, 9:05 AM - William Welles: yeah its crazy
1/2/18, 9:05 AM - Garrett Ienner: As did the books
1/2/18, 9:05 AM - William Welles: true
1/2/18, 9:05 AM - Garrett Ienner: I think I gotta crack one open again
1/2/18, 9:06 AM - Garrett Ienner: Maybe azkiban
1/2/18, 9:06 AM - William Welles: oh damn
1/2/18, 9:10 AM - Garrett Ienner: In 6, where they are at slughorns dinner party eating like 15 pounds of  profiteroles and they are all trashed
1/2/18, 9:10 AM - Garrett Ienner: Oh and when Harry takes the liquid luck and is walking around just coked out of his mind
1/2/18, 9:10 AM - Michael Lindsay: Stop trying to Trump away the fact that you're the one that changes ur mind and supports weird old shit (ep1, anti lotr)
1/2/18, 9:11 AM - William Welles: Oh yeah üòÇ
1/2/18, 9:11 AM - William Welles: Ep1 is best prequel everyone agrees
1/2/18, 9:11 AM - William Welles: It‚Äôs like an unchallenged opinion
1/2/18, 9:11 AM - Garrett Ienner: Yeah
1/2/18, 9:11 AM - Michael Lindsay: Ok Donald
1/2/18, 9:12 AM - William Welles: Lol we already went through this and 90% of the chat agreed including Garrett which means 2/3 of our 7th grade Star Wars crew agrees
1/2/18, 9:12 AM - William Welles: Everyone but you
1/2/18, 9:13 AM - Garrett Ienner: Ep 1 actually has cultural significance as a fluke
1/2/18, 9:13 AM - Garrett Ienner: The other 2 are just bad movies
1/2/18, 9:13 AM - William Welles: Ep one was the only prequel where lucas wasn't like asleep in a chair as they were making it
1/2/18, 9:14 AM - Garrett Ienner: Hahahaha
1/2/18, 9:14 AM - William Welles: only prequel that wasnt just shot on a green couch in a green room
1/2/18, 9:14 AM - Jared O'Connell: When episode 3 came out tho everyone was like ‚Äúoh this is a serious movie unlike the others‚Äù. In retrospect, ep 1 is best. I think that‚Äôs ur point, mike?
1/2/18, 9:15 AM - Garrett Ienner: (I love how Star Bros just took over bro chat)
1/2/18, 9:15 AM - William Welles: lol thats true
1/2/18, 9:16 AM - Jared O'Connell: Lucas was like ‚Äúhey I even had Spielberg direct a scene!!‚Äù
1/2/18, 9:16 AM - Garrett Ienner: Hahahaha
1/2/18, 9:22 AM - Miles Gilbert: What do u guys think about hp 7: part 1? I've always loved it for it's minimalism and sadness
1/2/18, 9:23 AM - Miles Gilbert: Especially between Ron and Hermione. Seeing their relationship be tested in a mature aay
1/2/18, 9:23 AM - Miles Gilbert: Way
1/2/18, 9:24 AM - William Welles: I'd have to rewatch, i def liked it more than 1. i remember my problems with it and they feel pretty minor in retrospect. I like the idea of them just hiding in the woods lotr style...
1/2/18, 9:24 AM - William Welles: the Ron Hermione relationship just never made sense to me but i think if i just give in to it it'd be chill
1/2/18, 9:25 AM - Miles Gilbert: Yea I mean it's a bit too classic of a foil
1/2/18, 9:25 AM - William Welles: *more than part 2 i meant
1/2/18, 9:25 AM - Miles Gilbert: Yea part two was a mess
1/2/18, 9:25 AM - William Welles: hermione is like this genius, in control person and Ron is unable to like get dressed without help
1/2/18, 9:29 AM - James Ewart: How do you guys feel about Jude Law playing a young Dumbledore in the next Fantastic Beasts?
1/2/18, 9:29 AM - Michael Lindsay: Sounds familiar ü§îü§îü§î
1/2/18, 9:29 AM - James Ewart: So sexy and fun!
1/2/18, 9:31 AM - Miles Gilbert: i hope he plays it like the young pope
1/2/18, 9:33 AM - William Welles: üëç
1/2/18, 9:42 AM - William Welles: What‚Äôs interesting about like‚Ä¶ the matrix or Star Wars is that they offer in-universe / universal explanations for magic/super powers.
1/2/18, 9:42 AM - William Welles: Compare to Harry Potter which has no explanation, or superheroes which have a different stupid explanation for every hero‚Ä¶ (except X-Men which is a little better)
1/2/18, 9:43 AM - William Welles: Star Wars is such a great universe, I'm excited or it to break away from the civil war/skywalkers... what the fuck is going down in the uncharted worlds
1/2/18, 9:47 AM - Miles Gilbert: <Media omitted>
1/2/18, 9:48 AM - Jared O'Connell: üëÜbeautiful

1/2/18, 9:51 AM - Garrett Ienner: Hahahahahah!
1/2/18, 9:52 AM - Garrett Ienner: Guys the Ron Hermione relationship works because she isn't threatened by Jim
1/2/18, 9:52 AM - Garrett Ienner: Him
1/2/18, 9:52 AM - Garrett Ienner: If she was with another genius, she would always be competing with him
1/2/18, 9:53 AM - Garrett Ienner: And she loves gingers
1/2/18, 9:53 AM - Garrett Ienner: Crookshanks was also ginger
1/2/18, 9:53 AM - William Welles: but there is a large gulf btwn not theatened and like.... Ron

1/2/18, 9:54 AM - William Welles: ron fights for things?
1/2/18, 9:54 AM - William Welles: i thought he just runs away and shits himself while H solves every problem
1/2/18, 9:54 AM - Garrett Ienner: He sacrificed himself a bunch
1/2/18, 9:54 AM - Garrett Ienner: When it counts
1/2/18, 9:54 AM - William Welles: H=hermione not Harry
1/2/18, 9:54 AM - Miles Gilbert: you can't ignore the difference in their families... i think hermione yearned for the safety and welcoming nature of his fam
1/2/18, 9:54 AM - Garrett Ienner: Help
1/2/18, 9:54 AM - Garrett Ienner: Yeeepp
1/2/18, 9:55 AM - Garrett Ienner: Sorry, typo
1/2/18, 9:55 AM - Garrett Ienner: And his family is super quirky wizard
1/2/18, 9:55 AM - Jared O'Connell: Freudian slip
1/2/18, 9:55 AM - Garrett Ienner: And she so muggle
1/2/18, 9:55 AM - Garrett Ienner: Lol
1/2/18, 9:55 AM - Garrett Ienner: Ron is exotic to her
1/2/18, 9:55 AM - Miles Gilbert: she had to leave her family in the beginning of 7: part 1 and it was heartbreaking
1/2/18, 9:55 AM - Garrett Ienner: But approachable at the same time
1/2/18, 9:55 AM - Garrett Ienner: And she can control
Him easily
1/2/18, 9:55 AM - Garrett Ienner: That was 6
1/2/18, 9:56 AM - Garrett Ienner: When she obliterated their memory of her
1/2/18, 9:56 AM - Miles Gilbert: ah right

1/2/18, 11:13 AM - William Welles: so I guess it defaults to top 11... ?
1/2/18, 11:13 AM - William Welles: they'd probably both be tied at 9 or 10 if I worked it out with more thought
1/2/18, 11:23 AM - William Welles: Get Out most exciting culturally, Good Time most exciting cinematically but flawed, CMBYN and YN made me cry the most, TLJ brought me the most Joy,

1/22/18, 3:26 PM - Garrett Ienner: Soon machines will do all that work and nobody will have a job
1/22/18, 3:26 PM - DL Tashjian: If you run a small business that manufactures hard goods, you have to assume you're going to be shipping packages every once in a while

1/24/18, 11:51 PM - Garrett Ienner: And she was in her later 30s there
1/24/18, 11:51 PM - Ege Soyuer: But also that movie is horribly sexist and racist
1/24/18, 11:51 PM - Garrett Ienner: How did a fucking Austrian guy get in the CIA anyway ?
1/24/18, 11:52 PM - Garrett Ienner: Bill Paxton was pure gold tho
1/24/18, 11:54 PM - Miles Gilbert: bill paxton's character said, "Ass as tight as a 10 year old boy" when describing a woman in this movie
1/24/18, 11:54 PM - Miles Gilbert: unbelievable
1/24/18, 11:54 PM - Ege Soyuer: Garrett asking the important questions tho
1/24/18, 11:55 PM - Ege Soyuer: The portrayal of brown ppl is one of the most Egregious I can think of
1/24/18, 11:56 PM - Garrett Ienner: Well we are supposed to hate his character so I guess that was an appropriate line
1/24/18, 11:56 PM - Ege Soyuer: It‚Äôs Prob trumps fave movie I‚Äôm just saying

1/25/18, 7:44 AM - Garrett Ienner: Yeah

1/26/18, 9:53 AM - Ege Soyuer: that movie will get made
1/26/18, 9:53 AM - Miles Gilbert: i think i would pick eagles and wolves
1/26/18, 9:53 AM - Ege Soyuer: Need that land/air
1/26/18, 9:53 AM - Miles Gilbert: i don't wanna deal with eagles coming to kill me
1/26/18, 9:53 AM - Miles Gilbert: yea exactly
1/26/18, 9:53 AM - Miles Gilbert: i think any bro who picks the guy with the gun has too much faith in guns
1/26/18, 9:53 AM - Miles Gilbert: maybe if it was an automatic
1/26/18, 9:54 AM - Miles Gilbert: 10000 rats tho... tbh got me scared
1/26/18, 9:55 AM - Miles Gilbert: but the eags will take care of them
1/26/18, 10:00 AM - Jared O'Connell: Eagles and rats
1/26/18, 10:00 AM - Jared O'Connell: Is the guaranteed winner
1/26/18, 10:01 AM - Jared O'Connell: The only thing that can beat the rats is the eagles
1/26/18, 10:01 AM - Ege Soyuer: How much damage Can a rat rly do
1/26/18, 10:01 AM - Jared O'Connell: 10,000 rats
1/26/18, 10:01 AM - Ege Soyuer: They can nibble
1/26/18, 10:01 AM - Ege Soyuer: 10000 nibbles
1/26/18, 10:01 AM - Jared O'Connell: Can swarm
1/26/18, 10:01 AM - Jared O'Connell: Yeah they have teeth
1/26/18, 10:01 AM - Ege Soyuer: They‚Äôre not like zerglings they‚Äôre slightly larger mice
1/26/18, 10:01 AM - Jared O'Connell: That‚Äôs like 200,000 teeth
1/26/18, 10:02 AM - Ege Soyuer: Yea but gorilla skin can withstand most bullets
1/26/18, 10:02 AM - Ege Soyuer: Lol miles what did you do
1/26/18, 10:05 AM - Miles Gilbert: i obliterated everyone's friday is what i fucking did
1/26/18, 10:05 AM - Miles Gilbert: jared... how can you expect rats and eagles to work together!
1/26/18, 10:06 AM - Miles Gilbert: natural enemies!
1/26/18, 10:06 AM - Jared O'Connell: But they are defending me in this scenario
1/26/18, 10:07 AM - Miles Gilbert: yea i guess
1/26/18, 10:07 AM - Miles Gilbert: i guess those are the rules
1/26/18, 10:08 AM - Jared O'Connell: i think the only thing that can defend you against 10,000 rats is eagles
1/26/18, 10:08 AM - Jared O'Connell: 10,000 rats will always win
1/26/18, 10:08 AM - Miles Gilbert: yea thats why i picked eagles for my team
1/26/18, 10:09 AM - Miles Gilbert: and i feel like wolves are smart
1/26/18, 10:09 AM - Miles Gilbert: and work in packs really well
1/26/18, 10:09 AM - Jared O'Connell: yeah but 10,000 rats will kill you in like 5 minutes
1/26/18, 10:09 AM - Jared O'Connell: and 50 eagles can't stop them fast enough
1/26/18, 10:09 AM - Jared O'Connell: none of those things can stop the rats fast enough
1/26/18, 10:09 AM - Jared O'Connell: against a human
1/26/18, 10:09 AM - Miles Gilbert: i dunno.. i think the rats will get super scared once the eagles start tearing into them
1/26/18, 10:10 AM - Miles Gilbert: the big question is: how far away are these attackers
1/26/18, 10:10 AM - Jared O'Connell: but in this scenario they would still be attacking you
1/26/18, 10:10 AM - Jared O'Connell: True-- if this is on a huge map it's different than a small map
1/26/18, 10:10 AM - Miles Gilbert: yea how big is the map
1/26/18, 10:10 AM - Miles Gilbert: ill ask the guy who posted it on twitter
1/26/18, 10:11 AM - Jared O'Connell: also-- are animals scattered randomly on the map
1/26/18, 10:11 AM - Jared O'Connell: or are they starting in a pack
1/26/18, 10:11 AM - Miles Gilbert: i assume pack
1/26/18, 10:12 AM - Jared O'Connell: assume nothing
1/26/18, 10:12 AM - Miles Gilbert: word
1/26/18, 10:13 AM - Miles Gilbert: still interested in other people's solutions to this problem
1/26/18, 10:13 AM - Ege Soyuer: I lold so hard
1/26/18, 10:14 AM - Miles Gilbert: Jared "Assume Nothing" O'Connell
1/26/18, 10:16 AM - Jared O'Connell: <Media omitted>
1/26/18, 10:16 AM - Miles Gilbert: dang
1/26/18, 10:17 AM - Miles Gilbert: oh wait.. those are Hawks not eagles
1/26/18, 10:17 AM - Miles Gilbert: anyway.. i still pick them
1/26/18, 10:20 AM - William Welles: Rats on offense Jared is obviously right
1/26/18, 10:20 AM - William Welles: Then lions ü¶Å bc the rats will do all the work but I wanna ride around on a lion
1/26/18, 10:20 AM - Ege Soyuer: Good point will
1/26/18, 10:20 AM - Miles Gilbert: lol... as long as u are aware that lions won't do shit
1/26/18, 10:20 AM - William Welles: Of course
1/26/18, 10:20 AM - Jared O'Connell: but maybe the hawks could hold you and fly
1/26/18, 10:20 AM - Ege Soyuer: My instinct was gorilla ü¶ç and the gun
1/26/18, 10:20 AM - Jared O'Connell: so you could fly....
1/26/18, 10:20 AM - William Welles: Cept like be my legendary mount
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Ege Soyuer: Which would also be the title of this movie
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Miles Gilbert: right dope mount
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - William Welles: Hawk ain‚Äôt carrying this big boy
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Jared O'Connell: i assumed it was a gunman with a gun, not a gun for you
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Jared O'Connell: but its 50 hawks
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Ege Soyuer: Yea can I get rid the dude
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - William Welles: Yeah idk want some bro petting my animals
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Miles Gilbert: yea its a bro who has probably only shot a gun like 2 times
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - William Welles: Like oops gotta reload
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Ege Soyuer: And just keep the gun
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Miles Gilbert: braguveet
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Ege Soyuer: Also that looks like a slow gun
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Miles Gilbert: yea no upgrades
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Ege Soyuer: Gotta reload every shot
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Miles Gilbert: no smoke
1/26/18, 10:22 AM - Ege Soyuer: That‚Äôs no good
1/26/18, 10:22 AM - William Welles: Rats will be down to the bone before he gets off two shots
1/26/18, 10:22 AM - Miles Gilbert: ok.. im starting to get into the rats
1/26/18, 10:22 AM - William Welles: Also like every other one you know when you‚Äôve confirmed the kill
1/26/18, 10:22 AM - Miles Gilbert: dang true
1/26/18, 10:22 AM - William Welles: Rats it‚Äôs like well I killed rats all day I bet I got them all
1/26/18, 10:23 AM - Miles Gilbert: then a rat comes for ur neck
1/26/18, 10:23 AM - William Welles: Then the remaining 9900 eat you in your sleep
1/26/18, 10:23 AM - William Welles: It‚Äôs like impossible to kill 10000 of anything
1/26/18, 10:24 AM - Ege Soyuer: Can u rly imagine 10,000 rats killing all those other animals
1/26/18, 10:24 AM - Ege Soyuer: Rats only work if you have eagles too
1/26/18, 10:24 AM - Ege Soyuer: Bc otherwise eagles will pick off all the rats
1/26/18, 10:24 AM - Ege Soyuer: But like, wolves eat rats for breakfast
1/26/18, 10:24 AM - Miles Gilbert: jared was right
1/26/18, 10:25 AM - Miles Gilbert: as fucking always
1/26/18, 10:25 AM - Ege Soyuer: Wolves are rly good at killing rats
1/26/18, 10:25 AM - Miles Gilbert: but the number 10000 is staggering
1/26/18, 10:25 AM - William Welles: Lol wolves eat like 7 rats and are like k I did it nap time
1/26/18, 10:26 AM - William Welles: Then get eaten by rats
1/26/18, 10:26 AM - William Welles: Plays out the same every time
1/26/18, 10:26 AM - Ege Soyuer: You guys are really underestimating the motivation of these characters
1/26/18, 10:26 AM - Ege Soyuer: Why do you think rats would be any more voracious than a wolf
1/26/18, 10:26 AM - William Welles: You can‚Äôt beat rats no one can
1/26/18, 10:26 AM - William Welles: Bc they‚Äôre rats!
1/26/18, 10:26 AM - William Welles: Rats eat shit just for fun
1/26/18, 10:26 AM - William Welles: Wolves only do for food
1/26/18, 10:27 AM - William Welles: And if you have 10k they‚Äôre always gunna be hungry
1/26/18, 10:27 AM - Ege Soyuer: Yea but this is offense defense kill time not snacktime
1/26/18, 10:27 AM - William Welles: Wolves get full and sleepy
1/26/18, 10:27 AM - Ege Soyuer: Hunger isn‚Äôt a factor!! They ain‚Äôt eating just killing!
1/26/18, 10:27 AM - William Welles: So they keep pounding 5 hour energy???
1/26/18, 10:27 AM - Ege Soyuer: Like eat 1 rat pet 100 killed prob
1/26/18, 10:27 AM - William Welles: An alpha predator uses all its energy making a kill
1/26/18, 10:27 AM - William Welles: It can‚Äôt just keep killing
1/26/18, 10:28 AM - Ege Soyuer: That seems Efficient
1/26/18, 10:28 AM - Miles Gilbert: i see ege's point... there's not a ton of info in this scenario... but because of the lack of info, i think we can assume that the two you pick will defend you until the end
1/26/18, 10:28 AM - William Welles: But once they fall asleep...
1/26/18, 10:28 AM - Miles Gilbert: i know we should never assume. but we need to put constraints on the scenario
1/26/18, 10:28 AM - William Welles: It‚Äôs like hunger games
1/26/18, 10:28 AM - Ege Soyuer: Lol why are wolves the only sleepy animal
1/26/18, 10:28 AM - William Welles: You gotta sleep
1/26/18, 10:28 AM - Miles Gilbert: wolves are sleepy lol
1/26/18, 10:28 AM - William Welles: And when you sleep the gnawing maw of the rats comes to greet you
1/26/18, 10:29 AM - William Welles: Wolves are 2nd most sleepy after lions
1/26/18, 10:30 AM - Miles Gilbert: that bro wit a gun is 3rd
1/26/18, 10:30 AM - James Ewart: I'm a sleepy bear today
1/26/18, 10:30 AM - Miles Gilbert: i guess it all comes down to who is the sleepiest
1/26/18, 10:30 AM - Ege Soyuer: Rats sleep too
1/26/18, 10:30 AM - Jared O'Connell: the rats can just tag team and take naps
1/26/18, 10:31 AM - Jared O'Connell: and still keep like 8000 in play
1/26/18, 10:31 AM - William Welles: Exactly J
1/26/18, 10:31 AM - Jared O'Connell: and none of those can kill more than like 20-30 rats per minute
1/26/18, 10:31 AM - William Welles: Exactly
1/26/18, 10:31 AM - William Welles: Unbeatable
1/26/18, 10:31 AM - William Welles: You could also cover yourself in living rat armor 10 rats thick
1/26/18, 10:32 AM - William Welles: And just roll around in a living rat ball
1/26/18, 10:32 AM - Ege Soyuer: A gorilla can just stomp around and kill 20-30 rats per second
1/26/18, 10:32 AM - Miles Gilbert: sleepiest ranking
1. lions
2. wolves
3. bro with a gun
4. bears (james)
5. water buff

1/26/18, 10:36 AM - James Ewart: I'd picks rats and crocs to protect, I like a good jump snap against the hawks and rats can't defeat crocs so I need them on my side
1/26/18, 10:36 AM - Ege Soyuer: It‚Äôs true crocs Skin so thick
1/26/18, 10:36 AM - Ege Soyuer: Ok I‚Äôm leaving the house
1/26/18, 10:36 AM - Miles Gilbert: yea.. interesting how the skin of a croc factors in
1/26/18, 10:36 AM - Miles Gilbert: ege ur never leaving
1/26/18, 10:37 AM - Ege Soyuer: I‚Äôm trapped this is the most exciting thing I‚Äôve gotta so today
1/26/18, 10:37 AM - Jared O'Connell: I think I could take the Croc myself, tbh
1/26/18, 10:37 AM - Miles Gilbert: and james, when i read jump snap... i pictured u standing on the top of the crocs mouth... then the croc snaps open his mouth launching you into the air to kill the hawk
1/26/18, 10:37 AM - Jared O'Connell: just have a handful of rats to help out if i get in trouble
1/26/18, 10:37 AM - Ege Soyuer: The rats could crawl into the crocs body
1/26/18, 10:37 AM - Ege Soyuer: And eat it from the inside
1/26/18, 10:38 AM - Miles Gilbert: ooooo
1/26/18, 10:38 AM - Ege Soyuer: When he takes a bite he gets a couple of whole ones
1/26/18, 10:38 AM - Jared O'Connell: true!
1/26/18, 10:38 AM - Ege Soyuer: Death from inside
1/26/18, 10:38 AM - Ege Soyuer: Fuck the rats are pretty good
1/26/18, 10:38 AM - Ege Soyuer: So versatile
1/26/18, 10:39 AM - James Ewart: Damn you're right!
1/26/18, 10:39 AM - Miles Gilbert: what about the Rat King problem
1/26/18, 10:40 AM - Miles Gilbert: u get that many rats together.. they are gonna get all tangled... maybe reduce their effectiveness
1/26/18, 10:40 AM - Jared O'Connell: i thought the rat king is a good thing
1/26/18, 10:41 AM - Miles Gilbert: it could prevent them from moving as freely
1/26/18, 10:41 AM - Miles Gilbert: might make it easier for a gorilla to stomp em out
1/26/18, 10:46 AM - Jared O'Connell: i guess that raises the question of what your influence is over the animals-- they're already doing something against their natural instincts. so, like, how exactly have they been "rewired" and will they still revert to certain natural instincts? which ones?
1/26/18, 10:47 AM - Miles Gilbert: seems like a cool little video game idea
1/26/18, 10:48 AM - William Welles: Also we forget that rats can breed the fastest by far
1/26/18, 10:49 AM - William Welles: So if this becomes a protracted siege they can bolster their numbers bc they can breed like... rats
1/26/18, 10:49 AM - Jared O'Connell: oh true-- if the map is large enough this could go on for a long enough time for breeding to take place.
1/26/18, 10:59 AM - Garrett Ienner: 183 texts my bros...

1/26/18, 3:43 PM - Garrett Ienner: By all the other animals

1/26/18, 6:44 PM - Miles Gilbert: So if u pick the rats, u gotta wait for all 10000 to get to the Bronx.

2/6/18, 7:41 AM - Jared O'Connell: Hbd will!
2/6/18, 7:42 AM - Jared O'Connell: Hollywood loved to celebrate and defend the slightly crazy male genius. Until now!!!

2/6/18, 12:49 PM - Michael Lindsay: Yeah but there are different ways to defend someone. "she was into it; sex with 13 year olds is fine" is not the same as "he's served his time"

2/7/18, 10:50 AM - Miles Gilbert: It ain't live. That would be cool
2/7/18, 10:50 AM - Jared O'Connell: oh yeah that could create some competition
2/7/18, 10:50 AM - William Welles: i need a weed that makes me do fun things instead of makes me eat pizza and fall asleep
2/7/18, 10:51 AM - Miles Gilbert: Lol
2/7/18, 10:51 AM - Ege Soyuer: there is value in eating pizza and falling asleep
2/7/18, 10:51 AM - Miles Gilbert: Tru

2/7/18, 10:51 AM - Ege Soyuer: how did you download the whole feed

2/7/18, 10:53 AM - Miles Gilbert: I'll check after I make breakfast. That's a cool data point
2/7/18, 10:53 AM - Miles Gilbert: Hit me up with any data points u want and I'll try to code them
2/7/18, 10:54 AM - Ege Soyuer: for word-count
2/7/18, 10:54 AM - Ege Soyuer: you should compare it to books of same word count
2/7/18, 10:54 AM - Ege Soyuer: like when we hit Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone
2/7/18, 10:54 AM - Ege Soyuer: vs War and peace
2/7/18, 10:54 AM - Miles Gilbert: Good idea!
2/7/18, 10:54 AM - Ege Soyuer: but that would need live update i guess
2/7/18, 10:54 AM - Ege Soyuer: is it easy to replace w a new data dump
2/7/18, 10:55 AM - Ege Soyuer: if you re-download every couple of days
2/7/18, 10:55 AM - William Welles: hahaha thats great ege
2/7/18, 10:55 AM - Ege Soyuer: id like to see comparison of words-used
2/7/18, 10:55 AM - Ege Soyuer: like who says anxiety the most
2/7/18, 10:55 AM - Ege Soyuer: spoiler alert its me
2/7/18, 10:56 AM - Ege Soyuer: but for all the top words
2/7/18, 10:56 AM - Ege Soyuer: also those word-size clouds they used to have one livejournals
2/7/18, 10:57 AM - Ege Soyuer: where its a bunch of words but the size of the word indicates amount used
2/7/18, 10:57 AM - Miles Gilbert: Def not doing word clouds I hate those
2/7/18, 10:58 AM - Miles Gilbert: Yea it's easy to replace with a new data dump
2/7/18, 10:58 AM - Miles Gilbert: Need to make it so u can upload right to the site from your phone
2/7/18, 10:58 AM - DL Tashjian: lol
2/7/18, 10:59 AM - DL Tashjian: maybe try to figure out who has the most rants
2/7/18, 10:59 AM - DL Tashjian: like most comments over x amount of words
2/7/18, 10:59 AM - DL Tashjian: or who drops the coolest pics
2/7/18, 11:00 AM - DL Tashjian: Like the biggest number of messages immediately following a pic post for a given amountoftime
2/7/18, 11:00 AM - William Welles: or who says who elses name the most
2/7/18, 11:00 AM - Ege Soyuer: will its you saying michaels name duh
2/7/18, 11:00 AM - DL Tashjian: also some sort of location map to determine where we've all been sending messages from
2/7/18, 11:01 AM - DL Tashjian: or why my spacebar sux
2/7/18, 11:01 AM - Ege Soyuer: i dont think the posts have GPS data do they holy shit that would be wild

2/7/18, 11:40 AM - Miles Gilbert: Short HP book is about 77k
2/7/18, 11:53 AM - Garrett Ienner: Hahahaha
2/7/18, 11:54 AM - Garrett Ienner: Many hands make light work ....
2/7/18, 11:54 AM - William Welles: Should we start talking to publishers or wait till we get a little more...
2/7/18, 11:56 AM - Garrett Ienner: I love how we already have sub stories, e.g. Starbros etc
2/7/18, 11:56 AM - Garrett Ienner: Publishers will like that
2/7/18, 12:07 PM - Jared O'Connell: you should sort the names frmo high to low participation right now the sorting is weird
2/7/18, 12:14 PM - Garrett Ienner: It's not a participation competition !
2/7/18, 12:15 PM - Miles Gilbert: Right
2/7/18, 12:19 PM - William Welles: It‚Äôs not a competition... but miles is winning
2/7/18, 12:21 PM - Garrett Ienner: Hahaha
2/7/18, 12:33 PM - Miles Gilbert: Lol
2/7/18, 12:47 PM - Michael Lindsay: I'm shocked by this data. Fundamentally don't understand how miles is at almost 2.5x my message count
2/7/18, 12:48 PM - Garrett Ienner: Does it go by amount of words or messages sent ?
2/7/18, 1:02 PM - Miles Gilbert: Messages sent
2/7/18, 1:03 PM - Miles Gilbert: So I'm thinking of a more xomplex way to define participation. Something That factors in messages sent and length of messages
2/7/18, 1:03 PM - Miles Gilbert: Mike I think it's cuz I tend to respond to messages with a lol or nice
2/7/18, 1:03 PM - Miles Gilbert: Or tru
2/7/18, 1:04 PM - Miles Gilbert: And I write many short messages while you write longer ones
2/7/18, 1:05 PM - Michael Lindsay: Then that should be borne out in word count ü§î
2/7/18, 1:06 PM - Miles Gilbert: What
2/7/18, 1:06 PM - Michael Lindsay: If ur messages are shorter than mine then our word counts should be closer than our message counts
2/7/18, 1:12 PM - Miles Gilbert: Ok. So you're saying I should just count the words?
2/7/18, 1:14 PM - Michael Lindsay: I think word count and words/message would be interesting to see
2/7/18, 1:23 PM - Miles Gilbert: Cool
2/7/18, 2:06 PM - Michael Lindsay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um0aZKbpe1Y

2/7/18, 3:42 PM - Jared O'Connell: What about avg word length? That‚Äôs a real sophisticatedish indicationation of intelligencenesses.
2/7/18, 4:41 PM - James Ewart: üòÇ
2/7/18, 5:44 PM - Jared O'Connell: James, as usual is right, you can‚Äôt quantify with metrics when someone just nails the right emoji.
2/7/18, 5:49 PM - William Welles: üëç
2/7/18, 6:06 PM - Michael Lindsay: curling coverage has started
2/7/18, 6:06 PM - William Welles: !!!
