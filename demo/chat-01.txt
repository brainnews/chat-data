9/14/17, 11:11 AM - Penelope Clearwater: 1b) there is now way the girl in red has an ass nice enough to turn around and look at
9/14/17, 11:11 AM - Penelope Clearwater: (different strokes i guess)
9/14/17, 11:12 AM - Severus Snape: Does one turn around bc of the ass or the face?
9/14/17, 11:13 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Can't see a face on someone walking away bro

9/14/17, 11:14 AM - Penelope Clearwater: its a good Q tho.. and I'm judging by her face that she doesn't have a nice ass
9/14/17, 11:14 AM - Penelope Clearwater: or like a head turning ass
9/14/17, 11:15 AM - Severus Snape: I'm saying the thing that makes you turn is you saw her face on the way by not the ass?
9/14/17, 11:15 AM - Penelope Clearwater: Ya totally... but i think it would be the hips
9/14/17, 11:15 AM - Penelope Clearwater: see dem hips coming towards u... a guy might have to turn and see that ass
9/14/17, 11:16 AM - Penelope Clearwater: if i seen that girls face on the street.. i'd be like "ok cute" but im not gonna risk a head turn
9/14/17, 11:16 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Gotta agree with miles

9/18/17, 12:29 PM - Draco Malfoy: They're actually kind of beautiful and have a nice pattern
9/18/17, 12:34 PM - Penelope Clearwater: What if cultivated a certain area of the exterior to be desirable to a slug to contain them while also being a steward of nature
9/18/17, 12:35 PM - Draco Malfoy: I dunno it's kind of complicated because they love living under the patio boards I think. So they'll always just be there. I'd need to rebuild the whole patio
9/18/17, 12:36 PM - Draco Malfoy: I think I'll just hunt them at night to reduce their numbers
9/18/17, 12:41 PM - Rubeus Hagrid: If you can't beat them join them
9/18/17, 12:41 PM - Draco Malfoy: Well the problem is I'll just start killing them accidentally then by stepping on them
9/18/17, 12:43 PM - Penelope Clearwater: gross
9/18/17, 12:44 PM - Luna Lovegood: If they're under the patio just salt it
9/18/17, 12:45 PM - Draco Malfoy: that might work

10/6/17, 8:57 AM - Minerva McGonagall: there better be a Wally Brando appearance in this movie
10/6/17, 10:51 AM - Severus Snape: Maybe it's the CBD but I'm feeling really affected and like shit about this country and white people the past 48 hours. I feel like I will have a lot of fighting to do in this life in this country
10/6/17, 12:15 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I don't think it's the CBD I think it's reality
10/6/17, 12:16 PM - Severus Snape: I am wondering if the CBD is making me more susceptible to emotionality and catastrophic thinking
10/6/17, 12:17 PM - Luna Lovegood: Umm 100% it puts you in a relaxed state that allows you to more comfortably embrace your emotions dude
10/6/17, 12:17 PM - Luna Lovegood: You're just letting yourself go down a rabbit hole so it gets more extreme
10/6/17, 12:18 PM - Luna Lovegood: But I have to agree with miles... It's reality dude
10/6/17, 12:18 PM - Severus Snape: The news is definitely a hole but I'm bored and have nothing else to do
10/6/17, 12:19 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I think you're just feeling it and that's a good thing
10/6/17, 12:19 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I've been more open with emotions this week. Particularly with Yolanda and my work mates. The reduced anxiety allows you to feel more and be more present
10/6/17, 12:20 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I'm v into it. Only been a week tho. I want to keep it up
10/6/17, 12:44 PM - Draco Malfoy: Is CBD the cannabis compound that doesn‚Äôt get you high?
10/6/17, 12:44 PM - Draco Malfoy: Cuz I find in general cannabis makes my anxiety and concerns amplified.
10/6/17, 12:47 PM - Penelope Clearwater: That's correct jared
10/6/17, 12:48 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I've seen chatter on the web about taking some CBD about an hour before smoking weed and that having good results with less weed anxiety
10/6/17, 12:48 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Have tried it casually and it is good
10/6/17, 12:49 PM - Draco Malfoy: I‚Äôd try it. Where do you buy CBD. I think I have it in ointment form though in some pain ointment I got in Colorado.
10/6/17, 12:50 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I got mine at this shop in Austin. You can buy it online but apparently there's a lot of scams out there selling cheap synthetic stuff
10/6/17, 12:51 PM - Penelope Clearwater: this reddit is good https://www.reddit.com/r/CBD/
10/6/17, 12:51 PM - Penelope Clearwater: check out the list of shops on the right
10/6/17, 12:51 PM - Penelope Clearwater: anyway.. its legal everywhere
10/6/17, 12:52 PM - Draco Malfoy: Oh really. I‚Äôll get some at the smoke shop near me then
10/6/17, 1:28 PM - Hermione Granger: It is just super mellow then?
10/6/17, 1:28 PM - Hermione Granger: Like body relax without all the psychoactive effects ?
10/6/17, 1:29 PM - Severus Snape: I describe it like a sleeping pill without the drowsiness
10/6/17, 1:29 PM - Luna Lovegood: apparently
10/6/17, 2:05 PM - Penelope Clearwater: for me, it's helping with a lot of social anxiety from being in a new place. i've been more able to openly embrace my own particular quirks in a way that had become difficult. i know it was anxiety because now that im just doing me again, nothing has changed in the way people treat me.
10/6/17, 2:06 PM - Penelope Clearwater: and all of that leads to relaxation
10/6/17, 2:07 PM - Penelope Clearwater: and yea, no psychoactive stuff
10/6/17, 2:59 PM - Penelope Clearwater: <Media omitted>

10/7/17, 10:33 AM - Penelope Clearwater: Lemme know when u fiends get outta the movie. I'm interested in ur take
10/7/17, 10:34 AM - Minerva McGonagall: I thought someone could cut it down by an hour and it would be good. Ege agrees. Mike thinks it's a blight on the earth
10/7/17, 10:34 AM - Luna Lovegood: He hated it?
10/7/17, 10:34 AM - Penelope Clearwater: Yea I'm somewhere in between
10/7/17, 10:34 AM - Luna Lovegood: I heard it was pretty great
10/7/17, 10:35 AM - Minerva McGonagall: It's brutally long and paced completely flat. I found it painful to watch
10/7/17, 10:35 AM - Penelope Clearwater: I think IF the hour that was cut out included the fetishization of the objectification of women then it could be saved from being the blight on the earth that it was
10/7/17, 10:35 AM - Penelope Clearwater: so painful
10/7/17, 10:35 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Yeah where were all the hot dude ads that's what I said when I came out
10/7/17, 10:36 AM - Penelope Clearwater: haha
10/7/17, 10:36 AM - Luna Lovegood: Lol
10/7/17, 10:36 AM - Penelope Clearwater: yea.. its like, damn the world sucks and everyones sad, but if ur a straight while male you get to be ryan gosling or harrison ford so its not so bad
10/7/17, 10:36 AM - Luna Lovegood: I gotta watch it now no more spoilers
10/7/17, 10:37 AM - Penelope Clearwater: i know its simplistic, but i just can't help but think how much more interesting the movie would have been if it were lead by a female
10/7/17, 10:37 AM - Penelope Clearwater: it still would have been to long, but at least it wouldn't have been boring as fuck
10/7/17, 10:37 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Eh. I don't think that would have saved this one personally
10/7/17, 10:37 AM - Minerva McGonagall: But I agree it's a Hollywood problem in general
10/7/17, 10:38 AM - Penelope Clearwater: yea. i'm not saying it would have saved the film, but at least it would be something different
10/7/17, 10:38 AM - Penelope Clearwater: and goddamnit can harrison ford just STOP acting
10/7/17, 10:39 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Stop putting Han Solo in every movie please
10/7/17, 10:39 AM - Penelope Clearwater: lol
10/7/17, 10:40 AM - Minerva McGonagall: I had over a gummy cuz I just kept popping quarters I was so bored
10/7/17, 10:40 AM - Penelope Clearwater: i was so high during the movie.. i got a lot of thinking done on other shit that was on my mind
10/7/17, 10:40 AM - Penelope Clearwater: lol

10/8/17, 4:49 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Damn boy
10/8/17, 4:51 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Wait wut
10/8/17, 4:53 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I hope it works. Don't fry it like my Japanese ps2!! üò§üò§üò≠üò≠

10/8/17, 4:53 PM - Penelope Clearwater: What's the diff
10/8/17, 4:54 PM - Severus Snape: Looks hot as hell
10/8/17, 4:55 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Yea looks dope fo sho. But I gotta know about dat content
10/8/17, 4:55 PM - Severus Snape: Same I think. Japan is diff
10/8/17, 5:11 PM - Penelope Clearwater: üëÑ
10/9/17, 12:12 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Did everyone see bad runner yet
10/9/17, 12:26 PM - Luna Lovegood: i liked it
10/9/17, 12:27 PM - Rubeus Hagrid: Not me but I don't mind spoilers
10/9/17, 12:27 PM - Luna Lovegood: i'm glad i didn't read all your guys messages until after i saw it tho
10/9/17, 12:27 PM - Luna Lovegood: as soon as i saw the rip shred tear happening i waited till i could scroll past tbh
10/9/17, 1:57 PM - Draco Malfoy: i didn't see it yet
10/9/17, 1:57 PM - Draco Malfoy: i will go see it eventually
10/9/17, 1:57 PM - Draco Malfoy: i was pretty excited until you guys started hating on it
10/9/17, 1:57 PM - Draco Malfoy: now i don't really want to see it lol
10/9/17, 1:57 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Good
10/9/17, 1:57 PM - Draco Malfoy: but to be honest, the first one is pretty grim on gender politics also
10/9/17, 1:58 PM - Draco Malfoy: so not really a surprise
10/9/17, 1:58 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Yea that's part of what makes this one even worse. They had 30 years
10/9/17, 1:58 PM - Severus Snape: 30 years in-universe. 35 actual years
10/9/17, 2:00 PM - Draco Malfoy: does it look cool though?
10/9/17, 2:00 PM - Draco Malfoy: because thats the best part of the original
10/9/17, 2:01 PM - Seamus Finnigan: It was beautiful, I think it's worth seeing
10/9/17, 2:01 PM - Seamus Finnigan: I just had problems w the storytelling
10/9/17, 2:01 PM - Seamus Finnigan: I didn't find it as sexist as miles
10/9/17, 2:01 PM - Severus Snape: Gonna wholly disagree with Ege
10/9/17, 2:02 PM - Seamus Finnigan: I think it could have been re-edited into a great film.
10/9/17, 2:02 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Just too much explanation, exposition, pandering to the audience.
10/9/17, 2:03 PM - Seamus Finnigan: But visually stunning and brutal and a devastating vision of the future
10/9/17, 2:03 PM - Seamus Finnigan: With a clumsily handled story
10/9/17, 2:05 PM - Luna Lovegood: i don't agree with the sexist stance. I almost believe that they specifically put that in there as a part of the shitty ass world it takes place in
10/9/17, 2:06 PM - Severus Snape: I think the movie had zero creativity or interesting thought, so I don't see that. Sloppy pandering to boomers/men
10/9/17, 2:07 PM - Luna Lovegood: this is like people hating the new star wars for not being something completely different
10/9/17, 2:07 PM - Severus Snape: Which was valid I think
10/9/17, 2:07 PM - Luna Lovegood: i dunno. what did you expect?
10/9/17, 2:07 PM - Severus Snape: That movie also happened to be entertaining
10/9/17, 2:08 PM - Luna Lovegood: i feel like you guys must think im a jabroni for enjoying this film
10/9/17, 2:09 PM - Seamus Finnigan: I enjoyed it but I just rly had to pee for the last hour bc it was TOO LONG and will and mike made me chug a beer before
10/9/17, 2:09 PM - Severus Snape: Eh, it's more that I have a philosophical objection to pandering filmmaking
10/9/17, 2:09 PM - Seamus Finnigan: It could have been a tight 90 min film
10/9/17, 2:09 PM - Draco Malfoy: well i guess thats also in keeping with the tradition of the original film
10/9/17, 2:09 PM - Severus Snape: Disagree
10/9/17, 2:09 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Yea but the original u can pause the dvd
10/9/17, 2:09 PM - Luna Lovegood: lol
10/9/17, 2:10 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Dayvaydayy
10/9/17, 2:11 PM - Penelope Clearwater: DL the film makes no effort to explain why or how the world became so shitty and the two white male characters are the only one who get a chance to tell their story. It's extremely white male centered like many films and that is the problem I have with it. At it's most innocent it's a boring film. At it's worst, it reinforces ideas that keep women and people of color in their place and preserves the status quo
10/9/17, 2:11 PM - Seamus Finnigan: I would agree it was too white-centric
10/9/17, 2:11 PM - Severus Snape: Pointlessly so
10/9/17, 2:12 PM - Penelope Clearwater: For the record I think the movie is sexist and racist
10/9/17, 2:12 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Both
10/9/17, 2:12 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Severely so
10/9/17, 2:12 PM - Seamus Finnigan: I agree w the racist bit. The only character of color was a child
Trafficker. For no reason. Could have easily been more diverse.
10/9/17, 2:12 PM - Seamus Finnigan: The sexist thing I don't see as much
10/9/17, 2:13 PM - Severus Snape: Who said the word slave four times
10/9/17, 2:13 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Why is the future of Los Angeles full of white people? What future are white people planning for us?
10/9/17, 2:13 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Sexism existing in the plot of movies is not the same as the movie being sexist
10/9/17, 2:13 PM - Luna Lovegood: I fully agree with the white wash
10/9/17, 2:13 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Not true
10/9/17, 2:13 PM - Severus Snape: But in this case I disagree Ege
10/9/17, 2:13 PM - Minerva McGonagall: The original film la was full of Asian people but all the leads were white
10/9/17, 2:14 PM - Severus Snape: The female characters are: a whore, a dialogueless woman that gets her stomach slit for jollies of the white male, a heartless robot assassin that gets brutally murdered
10/9/17, 2:14 PM - Penelope Clearwater: If the movie makes no effort to dive into the sexism it uses to create a 'shitty world's it's sexist
10/9/17, 2:15 PM - Minerva McGonagall: And his boss
10/9/17, 2:15 PM - Minerva McGonagall: The police chief or whatever
10/9/17, 2:15 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Yea the typical cold female boss
10/9/17, 2:15 PM - Severus Snape: Oh and a hard ass that... Also gets her stomach slit
10/9/17, 2:15 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Nothing new there
10/9/17, 2:15 PM - Penelope Clearwater: The female boss has been a problematic female trope for decades
10/9/17, 2:16 PM - Minerva McGonagall: And I agree w Ege in the abstract that sexism being involved in an narrative and a film being sexist are different things. But that's not to say I think this is the case here
10/9/17, 2:16 PM - Severus Snape: There is no more intentionally sex-provoking way to kill a woman than womb-slicing her
10/9/17, 2:16 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Um knife dick but sure
10/9/17, 2:16 PM - Severus Snape: That or strangling
10/9/17, 2:16 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Sure will, a movie can deal with sexism. But most use it superficially
10/9/17, 2:17 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Ya, I see what you mean
10/9/17, 2:17 PM - Seamus Finnigan: I guess it's so ubiquitous I didn't even think of it!
10/9/17, 2:17 PM - Seamus Finnigan: I did notice the race thing. Felt clumsy. Amongst other things.
10/9/17, 2:18 PM - Minerva McGonagall: It would be a more interesting argument if the film was otherwise good I think though.
10/9/17, 2:18 PM - Penelope Clearwater: But it's has a fucking 89% on rotten tomatoes
10/9/17, 2:18 PM - Seamus Finnigan: I enjoyed bits of it
10/9/17, 2:18 PM - Penelope Clearwater: It is good by definition to most
10/9/17, 2:19 PM - Minerva McGonagall: That's bc film critics don't exist anymore
10/9/17, 2:19 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Well
10/9/17, 2:19 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Just idiots online pandering
10/9/17, 2:19 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Yes
10/9/17, 2:19 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Still
10/9/17, 2:19 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Like baby driver. Which I thought was a well directed unique film that I'm glad exists but had weak gender roles
10/9/17, 2:20 PM - Penelope Clearwater: And I'm still just as mad about those offensive gender roles
10/9/17, 2:20 PM - Penelope Clearwater: That particular one
10/9/17, 2:23 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Yeah it's a more interesting discussion though bc i found that film not overtly sexist in a vacuum but just using older tropes. And for me not every film has an obligation to carry every social ball forward and the absence of incentive roles isn't always the same as a sexist narrative. And I also see the other side of the argument. BR is less interesting to me as a study bc it objectified women so much and was generally bad in a lot of ways
10/9/17, 2:24 PM - Severus Snape: Which film is the first half of that statement about? Br or bd
10/9/17, 2:25 PM - Minerva McGonagall: First have about bd
10/9/17, 2:27 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I just don't see a distinction between using older tropes and being overtly sexist. To me they are the same
10/9/17, 2:30 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Yeah I understand that. But for me the film was a fable which use simplistic characters and that was across both genders. And in a vacuum I don't find that problematic. But the current state of the broken industry and sexist world make it stand out
10/9/17, 2:31 PM - Minerva McGonagall: I mean I honestly see both sides. And like I also see a huge lack of creative unique mid budget films so I'm happy for that w bd bc I think the world needs that
10/9/17, 2:31 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Right. I love to analyze interesting things in vacuums and baby driver is a good example. I find it difficult to do that now and probably won't be ok with it for the rest of my life
10/9/17, 2:31 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Mlz did you like baby driver?
10/9/17, 2:32 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Did you find that movie sexist?
10/9/17, 2:32 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Yes. And yes.
10/9/17, 2:32 PM - Seamus Finnigan: It seems to me they are about the same level of sexist
10/9/17, 2:32 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Sexist is sexist
10/9/17, 2:32 PM - Seamus Finnigan: I guess blade runner was a bit more.
10/9/17, 2:32 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I'm not on levels here
10/9/17, 2:32 PM - Seamus Finnigan: 1 out 10
10/9/17, 2:32 PM - Seamus Finnigan: How sexy
10/9/17, 2:32 PM - Seamus Finnigan: I mean sexist
10/9/17, 2:32 PM - Severus Snape: Br was misogynistic IMO
10/9/17, 2:33 PM - Minerva McGonagall: I don't think baby driver was sexist I think it lacked interesting female roles. For me they aren't quite the same. It didn't advance the ball but wasn't problematic. And I don't feel every film has to... I wish it had but I found br more problematic from a gender pov
10/9/17, 2:37 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Film is art and individual expression and incredibly hard and we can easily get to the point where we champion shitty work w good gender roles (e.g. glow) over like really interesting work that doesn't move the ball forward (e.g. Young pope to stick e tv)
10/9/17, 2:37 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Haha. I really liked glow
10/9/17, 2:38 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I see your points will. We'll have to disagree on this one I think
10/9/17, 2:42 PM - Minerva McGonagall: That's cool. I see your points too and don't even disagree w them... I think it's interesting and complicated all around. And agree w all the problems w representation. I think for you neutral on gender issues is inherently negative where for me it is neutral. Beau travail barely has a female on screen but it still rips me apart and has me balling by the end.... anyway we've probably talked this t death
10/9/17, 2:46 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I get u about talking it to death, but We can't stop talking about this overall issue. I'd encourage everyone to view their own everday actions through the lens of gender and how the things we consume affect us and the people around us. Identifying problems within the things we love doesn't mean we can't love them anymore. We just want them to be better.
10/9/17, 2:46 PM - Seamus Finnigan: I recently rewatched Independence Day
10/9/17, 2:47 PM - Seamus Finnigan: And I wanna love it
10/9/17, 2:47 PM - Seamus Finnigan: But man the 90s were brutally sexist
10/9/17, 2:48 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Fair enough. And I like that nuanced take. But a lot of people don't have that. And that's what worrys me. For me in art we need to find a way to progress while allowing different types of interesting work to exist.
10/9/17, 2:48 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Yea. Less white men being the only creators please
10/9/17, 2:48 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Well sure
10/9/17, 2:49 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Beau travail is good example. Directed by woman but only men in it
10/9/17, 2:50 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Hadn't heard of this movie. Will add it to the list
10/9/17, 2:50 PM - Minerva McGonagall: And about masculinity and how it destroys men
10/9/17, 2:51 PM - Penelope Clearwater: <Media omitted>
10/9/17, 2:52 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Christmas is right around the corner william
10/9/17, 2:54 PM - Minerva McGonagall: I mean the ending of it made me cry more than like any movie i can think of
10/9/17, 2:54 PM - Luna Lovegood: well shit now i feel like a jabroni for realz. I'm sorry guys.
10/9/17, 2:54 PM - Seamus Finnigan: U ain't a jabroni DL
10/9/17, 2:54 PM - Draco Malfoy: Guys I saw Harvey Weinstein in a panel last week championing women in film. Things are changing (true story)
10/9/17, 2:55 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Rly? Pre-allegations or post?
10/9/17, 2:55 PM - Draco Malfoy: Pre NYT
10/9/17, 2:55 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Dang
10/9/17, 2:55 PM - Draco Malfoy: Maybe it was 2 weeks ago
10/9/17, 2:55 PM - Draco Malfoy: Well he knew it was coming out so
10/9/17, 2:56 PM - Draco Malfoy: What a üí©
10/9/17, 3:03 PM - Penelope Clearwater: DL you don't need to apologise to me. We should be having these conversations and you are free to disagree with any of them. But if you find any of my arguments valid please use your power as a male to call them out when u see them. It can be difficult because few people are able to engage in thoughtful discourse like will and they'll jump to simplistic explanations that 'prove' their side. I've found it to be helpful to listen to more female voices as I try to better myself as a man and begin to undo some of the toxic masculinity that was pumped in to me as a child and teenager and even in my 20s
10/9/17, 3:14 PM - Draco Malfoy: Upvote
10/9/17, 3:15 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Word
10/9/17, 3:15 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Understanding the patriarchy destroyed us like it destroyed women is a great starting point
10/9/17, 3:15 PM - Minerva McGonagall: I mean also. Not in the same manner to the same degree
10/9/17, 3:16 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Yeah totally
10/9/17, 3:21 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Just make sure to listen 10x more than u speak.
10/9/17, 3:28 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I'm about to watch The Mummy (2017). Wish me luck
10/9/17, 3:29 PM - Minerva McGonagall: You're a glutton for pain
10/9/17, 3:31 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Right now I'm really interested in passive representation in film. More for queer characters than other things. But I think it's still backwards that any movie right now w a queer protagonist has to explicitly be about their gayness or coming out. Film im writing now has bi male protag but film isn't about that at all it's just in the texture of character and narrative
10/9/17, 3:43 PM - Severus Snape: I'm into any representation that has texture of character. Thoughtless/purposeless characterization of either swm or anything else is my enemy
10/9/17, 6:54 PM - Penelope Clearwater: <Media omitted>
10/9/17, 6:54 PM - Severus Snape: ü§ß
10/9/17, 6:55 PM - Seamus Finnigan: How's it

10/9/17, 6:57 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Oddly
10/9/17, 7:45 PM - Severus Snape: Lol that's great
10/9/17, 7:58 PM - Draco Malfoy: haha
10/9/17, 7:59 PM - Draco Malfoy: anyone really psyched about the star wars trailer lol
10/9/17, 7:59 PM - Draco Malfoy: i am.
10/9/17, 8:13 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Lol I saw a commercial for it at the gym today
10/9/17, 9:14 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Did it happen already
10/9/17, 9:47 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Woah that trailer feels like spoooilerrr aleeerrrttt

10/10/17, 12:30 PM - Draco Malfoy: I guess Florida/sunbelt life is different but I‚Äôm prettttty sure shorts are never really appropriate at work in even a fairly casual professional environment but if you are definitely going to wear them might as well go super short.

10/12/17, 8:17 AM - Draco Malfoy: No there‚Äôs an interview with the director where he says that they made them because there were puffins on skellig Michael
10/12/17, 8:17 AM - Draco Malfoy: And they wanted a character like the puffins

10/12/17, 2:12 PM - Rubeus Hagrid: Are you gonna dip down to Mahahual for some fresh ceviche?
10/12/17, 2:19 PM - Penelope Clearwater: And some smokey treats
10/12/17, 2:20 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Not sure Ege. I guess Yolanda's friends are a bit different from us in terms of life stages. But like, everyone is ya feel me?
10/12/17, 2:21 PM - Penelope Clearwater: fwiw Yolanda and I are not rushing to the altar. We are committed but focused on other aspects of life at the moment.
10/12/17, 2:29 PM - Draco Malfoy: That‚Äôs cool.
10/12/17, 2:29 PM - Draco Malfoy: Do you guys think if Harvey W wasn‚Äôt a gross slug creature you would find it less gross
10/12/17, 2:30 PM - Rubeus Hagrid: This year has been so many weddings for me!
10/12/17, 2:30 PM - Severus Snape: Not at all
10/12/17, 2:30 PM - Severus Snape: Did you listen to the audio?
10/12/17, 2:32 PM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah the audio makes me sick I wasn‚Äôt saying I think so. But it doesn‚Äôt help that he‚Äôs a gross slug creature either.
10/12/17, 2:32 PM - Draco Malfoy: Like I think he‚Äôs the ugliest person ive ever seen
10/12/17, 2:33 PM - Severus Snape: I've seen worse and that's your personal opinion. I could see a lot of people fetishizing his aesthetic
10/12/17, 2:33 PM - Draco Malfoy: True

10/16/17, 3:31 PM - Draco Malfoy: I worked from home so I‚Äôm actually feeling pretty chill ü§°
10/16/17, 4:16 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Back from tulum taking a buffer day before work. Feeling pretty chill I guess. But having some anxiety about what to do with free time

10/16/17, 10:34 PM - Penelope Clearwater: will, i really appreciated your post on FB about our roles in the patriarchy and about the need to do better as men. it inspired me to write my own post. thank you
10/16/17, 10:35 PM - Penelope Clearwater: (i haven't shared it yet because I think it's too long and I want to edit it)
10/16/17, 10:42 PM - Rubeus Hagrid: I totally agree, very nicely said Will
10/16/17, 10:43 PM - Rubeus Hagrid: To the best of my knowledge #metoo started yesterday, or that's when I started seeing it
10/16/17, 10:43 PM - Minerva McGonagall: I think me too started when one of the women who spoke up about Harvey requested it but I'm not 100% sure. I felt conflicted about writing anything but ultimately did
10/16/17, 10:43 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Not requested but like suggested
10/16/17, 10:43 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Sorry I'm stoked
10/16/17, 10:44 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Stoned
10/16/17, 10:44 PM - Penelope Clearwater: same
10/16/17, 10:44 PM - Penelope Clearwater: ok.. yea, i was on vacation and came back to twitter today
10/16/17, 10:45 PM - Penelope Clearwater: i feel like adding my voice as a male to the conversation feels wrong, but then i think about how amazing it would be if and when a white person speaks out about racism against black people and admits their complicity in it, so in the end i think its necessary
10/16/17, 10:46 PM - Penelope Clearwater: but i still feel weird about appropriation of the airwaves
10/16/17, 10:47 PM - Penelope Clearwater: i saw a friend (female) on my fb feed propose #ihave for me
10/16/17, 10:47 PM - Penelope Clearwater: men
10/16/17, 11:01 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Yeah I felt conflicted too. Ultimately I saw a lot of female voices online say they wished men would talk about their part in these problems which influenced my decision.
10/16/17, 11:03 PM - Minerva McGonagall: For the little it's worth I think progress is only possible when their is unity in fighting for these things. And I see too many men remaining disconnected from these issues bc they are in their minds not part of the problem
10/16/17, 11:05 PM - Minerva McGonagall: But for me I know patriarchy fucked my mind up in a lot of ways and gave me a lot of shame but worse than that it implanted what I came to understand as racist and sexist ways of seeing the world that have to be actively identified and confronted.
10/16/17, 11:37 PM - Penelope Clearwater: 100% agree
10/17/17, 10:56 AM - Penelope Clearwater: I feel like this is a mike lindsay trivia question waiting to be asked: https://qz.com/1070266/the-name-of-a-country-can-only-really-mean-one-of-four-things/

10/17/17, 11:05 AM - Severus Snape: "By our count, there are roughly another 25 countries named for some person of importance‚Äîin all cases but one, a man. According to language blogger Paul Anthony Jones, St. Lucia, a third-century woman from Syracuse, is the exception." Too bad St Lucia is too obscure a country make this usable

11/6/17, 2:52 PM - Penelope Clearwater: wtf are u guys talking about
11/6/17, 2:53 PM - Luna Lovegood: One Tough Cop is based on Bo Dietl's life
11/6/17, 2:53 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Guys I didn't do my research on whomst to vote for tomorrow
11/6/17, 2:53 PM - Seamus Finnigan: I just know def no on the const convention referendum
11/6/17, 2:53 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Jared you got the scoop?
11/6/17, 2:54 PM - Luna Lovegood: you guys St. Augustine has the raddest mayor
11/6/17, 2:54 PM - Luna Lovegood: She's from Mt. Kisco
11/6/17, 2:54 PM - Penelope Clearwater: ah cool thanks DL
11/6/17, 2:58 PM - Luna Lovegood: Just sayin
11/6/17, 3:05 PM - Draco Malfoy: He was my uncles detective partner in the 70/
11/6/17, 3:05 PM - Draco Malfoy: 70s
11/6/17, 3:05 PM - Draco Malfoy: But he‚Äôs like an insane person
11/6/17, 3:05 PM - Draco Malfoy: I mean I‚Äôm going to vote for DeBlasio for mayor
11/6/17, 3:06 PM - Penelope Clearwater: damn. that must have been crazy... nyc in the 70s and ur a detective
11/6/17, 3:08 PM - Draco Malfoy: The big question is the constitutional convention.
11/6/17, 3:08 PM - Draco Malfoy: Which I don‚Äôt really know the answer to
11/6/17, 3:12 PM - Draco Malfoy: Anyone have any thoughts on the Constitutional Convention?
11/6/17, 3:13 PM - Seamus Finnigan: nytimes editorial board says no
11/6/17, 3:13 PM - Seamus Finnigan: New York daily news says yes
11/6/17, 3:13 PM - Seamus Finnigan: That's all I got
11/6/17, 3:13 PM - Draco Malfoy: I guess I‚Äôll read the logic of those editorials
11/6/17, 3:24 PM - Luna Lovegood: Jared is that Uncle Sonny?
11/6/17, 3:24 PM - Draco Malfoy: I guess the nytimes is saying basically the risk of the convention resulting in a fucked up new constitution is too high. So even though the constitution is outdated and problematic and should be changed, we can‚Äôt because it‚Äôll be a corrupt process and the risk is too high that it will make things worse.
11/6/17, 3:25 PM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah uncle Sonny
11/6/17, 3:25 PM - Luna Lovegood: Nice
11/6/17, 3:27 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Damn that's a fucked up reason
11/6/17, 3:27 PM - Draco Malfoy: But like elections are volatile now so makes sense to me
11/6/17, 3:28 PM - Draco Malfoy: And citizens united means moneyed interests can control the process
11/6/17, 3:28 PM - Seamus Finnigan: The only counter argument to the nytimes perspective heard so far is "naaaah c'mon you're exaggerating"
11/6/17, 3:29 PM - Luna Lovegood: that's insane
11/6/17, 3:36 PM - Draco Malfoy: James Lane looks cool for Public Advocate.
11/6/17, 4:00 PM - Draco Malfoy: Ege are you going pro convention or no
11/6/17, 4:00 PM - Seamus Finnigan: I'm goin no
11/6/17, 4:01 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Too many crooked ppl in state govt. can't be trusted to not turn over public lands for fracking
11/6/17, 4:06 PM - Penelope Clearwater: That's a big one
11/6/17, 4:08 PM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah fracking and like privatize the MTA
11/6/17, 4:08 PM - Draco Malfoy: Rather than actually make the MTA less corrupt
11/6/17, 4:12 PM - Minerva McGonagall: I think I‚Äôm in favor. The potential upside is just as big as the downside and the state leans left
11/6/17, 4:13 PM - Seamus Finnigan: The state legislature does not lean left as far as I know
11/6/17, 4:13 PM - Seamus Finnigan: And they would be deciding what goes in
11/6/17, 4:14 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I guess the concern is that people won't pay attention to the issues that come up for consideration in the new Constitution
11/6/17, 4:14 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Don‚Äôt we vote on delegates?
11/6/17, 4:14 PM - Minerva McGonagall: If we decide to do it?
11/6/17, 4:14 PM - Penelope Clearwater: People can still vote on the new ideas in the new Constitution right?
11/6/17, 4:15 PM - Minerva McGonagall: I didn‚Äôt think state legislature ran it I thought we get to vote on delegates
11/6/17, 4:15 PM - Seamus Finnigan: don't know! Gotta do more research
11/6/17, 4:15 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Do you hAve any good reading on it
11/6/17, 4:16 PM - Penelope Clearwater: The convention, or Con Con, as it‚Äôs known in political circles, is an opportunity to make profound, long-lasting, and much-needed changes to New York‚Äôs outdated state constitution ‚Äî or open a Pandora‚Äôs box that could doom working people forever, depending on whom you ask. I‚Äôve written in¬†favor¬†of holding a¬†convention¬†before, but with the vote fast approaching, it‚Äôs a good time to lay out arguments for and against the measure, so New York voters understand what‚Äôs at stake and what could happen if a majority of them approve rewriting the state constitution.

If a majority statewide votes ‚Äúyes,‚Äù a constitutional convention will be set for the spring of 2019. The convention would be made up of elected delegates, with three provided from each state senate district ‚Äî there are 63 in total ‚Äî plus fifteen statewide. Elections would occur next year, and anyone can run to be a delegate.

These delegates would come together with unlimited abilities to propose amending the constitution in any and all ways they can agree upon. Any amendments approved by delegates would need to be ultimately approved by the voters. This is important to remember: No changes can occur to the constitution without statewide approval at the ballot box.
11/6/17, 4:17 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Yeah I think the point of it is it‚Äôs a way to make change without the state legislature being involved
11/6/17, 4:17 PM - Minerva McGonagall: So it‚Äôs a way to break past all the bullshit hurdles and corruption
11/6/17, 4:18 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Also it seems all the evil people don‚Äôt want it to happen...
11/6/17, 4:18 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Ugh here I am blindly trusting the nytimes editorial board but clearly it's more complicated
11/6/17, 4:18 PM - Minerva McGonagall: And we then get to vote again on each thing the delegates decide
11/6/17, 4:18 PM - Minerva McGonagall: So it seemingly gives the people far far more power than is the norm
11/6/17, 4:19 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Tell ur friends to get out and vote
11/6/17, 4:19 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I'd vote Yes. But vote either way. Just vote.
11/6/17, 4:43 PM - Draco Malfoy: I like the idea of voting yes
11/6/17, 4:44 PM - Draco Malfoy: I think the fear is that money will control the delegate voting process. But we can deal with that then, I suppose.
11/6/17, 4:44 PM - Draco Malfoy: But yeah way more money is behind the No vote than Yes vote
11/6/17, 4:45 PM - Draco Malfoy: Which is a weird coalition of powerful leaders from both parties
11/6/17, 4:47 PM - Draco Malfoy: Polling shows a preference for Yes but declining steadily over the past few weeks but the share of undecideds is very high.
11/6/17, 4:54 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Get out the vote!!
11/6/17, 4:54 PM - Draco Malfoy: I see a lot of bumper stickers that are anti con con
11/6/17, 4:55 PM - Draco Malfoy: Con con con
11/6/17, 4:56 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Wow really
11/6/17, 5:01 PM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah around my neighborhood. I think car owners skew more conservative in my hood, for some reason.
11/6/17, 5:02 PM - Draco Malfoy: But I also think environmentalists are con con con
11/6/17, 5:02 PM - Seamus Finnigan: The money being mostly in the no camp makes me wanna vote yes
11/6/17, 5:02 PM - Draco Malfoy: I feel the same way
11/6/17, 5:03 PM - Draco Malfoy: But then I wonder if that‚Äôs a bad reason.
11/6/17, 5:03 PM - Seamus Finnigan: But yea I've heard it could be dangerous for the environment bc there will be huge lobbying for accessing public lands for fracking
11/6/17, 5:03 PM - Draco Malfoy: Not just fracking either
11/6/17, 5:04 PM - Draco Malfoy: They‚Äôre also really clever at coming up with ways to make initiatives to open up lands seem benign
11/6/17, 5:05 PM - Minerva McGonagall: NY State gov is such a cesspool anyway to make change by circumventing them is worth the risk in my book
11/6/17, 5:06 PM - Draco Malfoy: By like tying them to funding for liberal causes or like ‚Äúwe‚Äôll just use 100 acres and then create a new nature preserve that is 10,000 acres‚Äù but it‚Äôs a trick
11/6/17, 5:06 PM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah I think I‚Äôll vote Yes after our convo
11/6/17, 5:12 PM - Penelope Clearwater: <Media omitted>
11/6/17, 5:24 PM - Draco Malfoy: <Media omitted>
11/6/17, 5:28 PM - Severus Snape: Miles doin chores!!! Yes!
11/6/17, 5:29 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Jared :(
11/6/17, 5:29 PM - Seamus Finnigan: That's sad
11/6/17, 5:33 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Brian Lehrer hosted a debate on WNYC between yes and no. Oxford style debate. Listening now. P. Good.
11/6/17, 5:33 PM - Draco Malfoy: Oooh I‚Äôll check that out
11/6/17, 5:34 PM - Seamus Finnigan: It's from oct 16 I think
11/6/17, 5:44 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Here's a detail: NAACP, ACLU, planned parenthood are all pushing Nos
11/6/17, 5:44 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Oh gods now it‚Äôs confusing again
11/6/17, 5:47 PM - Seamus Finnigan: As does the civil liberties union
11/6/17, 5:47 PM - Minerva McGonagall: That‚Äôs the aclu
11/6/17, 5:47 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Sorry nyclu
11/6/17, 5:47 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Yea same thing
11/6/17, 5:48 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Hmm
11/6/17, 5:48 PM - Seamus Finnigan: https://www.nysut.org/news/2017/june/broad-coalition-announces-opposition-to-a-constitutional-convention
11/6/17, 5:49 PM - Seamus Finnigan: but like so does the ny rifle and pistol association
11/6/17, 5:49 PM - Seamus Finnigan: this is a confusing one
11/6/17, 5:50 PM - Draco Malfoy: I think basically there is a sort of policial balance of power right now
11/6/17, 5:50 PM - Draco Malfoy: And the con con opens the possibility of changing it
11/6/17, 5:50 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Weird
11/6/17, 5:50 PM - Penelope Clearwater: And no one wants to tip the scales
11/6/17, 5:50 PM - Draco Malfoy: Well everyone wants to tip the scale
11/6/17, 5:51 PM - Draco Malfoy: But yeah, there‚Äôs a fear it‚Äôll tip the other way
11/6/17, 5:52 PM - Seamus Finnigan: a lot of ppl in this debate are talking about citizens united
11/6/17, 5:52 PM - Seamus Finnigan: is the reason why this is a bad idea
11/6/17, 5:52 PM - Seamus Finnigan: bc koch bros can put unlimited money
11/6/17, 5:52 PM - Seamus Finnigan: into pushing their agenda
11/6/17, 5:53 PM - Seamus Finnigan: its not gonna be a fair fight
11/6/17, 5:53 PM - Seamus Finnigan: is the fear
11/6/17, 5:53 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Hmm
11/6/17, 5:53 PM - Draco Malfoy: Right
11/6/17, 5:54 PM - Seamus Finnigan: this wnyc debate is interesting bc its progressives on both sides
11/6/17, 5:54 PM - Seamus Finnigan: the debate isnt along party lines at all
11/6/17, 5:55 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Hrrrrm
11/6/17, 5:55 PM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah, listening now
11/6/17, 5:56 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Maybe it‚Äôs just how risk averse you are
11/6/17, 5:56 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Could be big gains at a higher risk. Or preserve the broken status quo and try to incrementally improve within it
11/6/17, 5:57 PM - Seamus Finnigan: the other arguemtn for 'no' is low voter turnout and voter apathy... so it will be even more open for manipulation
11/6/17, 6:00 PM - Draco Malfoy: So Ege where do you stand now
11/6/17, 6:00 PM - Draco Malfoy: I‚Äôm really on the fence!!!
11/6/17, 6:00 PM - Seamus Finnigan: dude i dont know! me too!
11/6/17, 6:01 PM - Seamus Finnigan: im leaning no
11/6/17, 6:01 PM - Seamus Finnigan: but im open to yes
11/6/17, 6:04 PM - Draco Malfoy: I like the idea that the delegates may not be co opted yet so they may actually do something to clean up gerrymandering and the general way Albany works
11/6/17, 6:09 PM - Seamus Finnigan: both sides are v convincing
11/6/17, 6:09 PM - Minerva McGonagall: I‚Äôm sticking w yes I think
11/6/17, 6:10 PM - Minerva McGonagall: I‚Äôm just as scared of these entrenched systems than anything.
11/6/17, 6:10 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Is there a lawful neutral chaotic chart for this
11/6/17, 6:10 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Omg miles
11/6/17, 6:10 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Soery
11/6/17, 6:10 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Lol
11/6/17, 6:10 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Yes is def chaotic side
11/6/17, 6:11 PM - Seamus Finnigan: i think if it wins
11/6/17, 6:11 PM - Seamus Finnigan: we should get really involved in picking delegates
11/6/17, 6:11 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Yeah
11/6/17, 6:11 PM - Seamus Finnigan: slash maybe one of us should run as one
11/6/17, 6:11 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Luckily if it wins we still get multiple other votes to try to keep it good
11/6/17, 6:13 PM - Seamus Finnigan: fyi in the debate the ppl on the No side are all POC's
11/6/17, 6:13 PM - Seamus Finnigan: and the ppl on the yes side are all white
11/6/17, 6:13 PM - Seamus Finnigan: üòá
11/6/17, 6:13 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Hhhhhmmmmnnn
11/6/17, 6:14 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Lots of great research ege
11/6/17, 6:14 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Wonder if it‚Äôs a bad sample group or indicative of something more
11/6/17, 6:14 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Why do u write up your findings and do a post?
11/6/17, 6:14 PM - Penelope Clearwater: *Don't
11/6/17, 6:14 PM - Seamus Finnigan: bc i really cant decide
11/6/17, 6:14 PM - Seamus Finnigan: im still listening to the debate
11/6/17, 6:15 PM - Penelope Clearwater: But just the data is interesting without a decision
11/6/17, 6:15 PM - Seamus Finnigan: they address the race thing in the debate and both sides dismissed it so maybe just small sample size
11/6/17, 6:16 PM - Seamus Finnigan: yea but it does come down to risk aversion. the no side is jaded and thinks itll go evil. the yes side is hopeful and thinks its the only way to make real change in the status quo. tough call. both sides are convincing
11/6/17, 6:20 PM - Seamus Finnigan: it seems like a lot of the fear about the risks of loss have to do with how badly other, unrelated votes have gone internationally.
11/6/17, 6:20 PM - Seamus Finnigan: like brexit and trump and other right wing swings. i feel like if hillary had won, the 'no' voice would be quieter
11/6/17, 6:21 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Makes sense
11/6/17, 7:23 PM - Draco Malfoy: FYI I‚Äôm leaning yes
11/6/17, 7:23 PM - Draco Malfoy: So I assume you mean Jared side as in the point Jared made earlier
11/6/17, 7:25 PM - Draco Malfoy: There‚Äôs also the interesting point about how it would influence the movement for a national con con
11/6/17, 7:29 PM - Draco Malfoy: Oh I misread jaded as Jared lol
11/6/17, 7:30 PM - Draco Malfoy: I disagree with jaded/hopeful.
11/6/17, 7:30 PM - Draco Malfoy: But it seems like seeing how the process unfolds if yes succeeds would be a good thing and there will be a 2nd far more consequential vote.
11/6/17, 7:32 PM - Draco Malfoy: Nytimes makes a subtle but important note about delegate selection: Delegates would be chosen according to the contours of the gerrymandered State Senate
11/6/17, 7:33 PM - Draco Malfoy: Also I don‚Äôt think the PoC thing is due to small sample size but says something about the way NY state politics and gerrymandering works
11/6/17, 7:35 PM - Draco Malfoy: I.e white upstate voters have disproportionate representation in state govt
11/6/17, 7:40 PM - Draco Malfoy: Miles what‚Äôs on your ballot tomorrow??
11/6/17, 7:50 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Not much. Stuff like whether or not banks can give gifts to people for signing up for new savings accounts and more benefits for disabled vets
11/6/17, 7:50 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Small town stuff
11/6/17, 7:55 PM - Draco Malfoy: Are you yes on banks or no
11/6/17, 7:56 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Yes because it will help credit Unions compete with big branches
11/6/17, 7:56 PM - Draco Malfoy: Oh that‚Äôs good
11/7/17, 7:52 AM - Draco Malfoy: I voted üôä
11/7/17, 7:55 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Just realized I have a ct Id... trying to find a bill or something üôÑ
11/7/17, 7:56 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Are you sure you need ny id.
11/7/17, 7:57 AM - Seamus Finnigan: You may just need valid id
11/7/17, 7:57 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Or passport
11/7/17, 7:57 AM - Seamus Finnigan: As long as you're reg'd
11/7/17, 8:00 AM - Draco Malfoy: You don‚Äôt need ID at all
11/7/17, 8:00 AM - Draco Malfoy: What is this, Texas? Jk
11/7/17, 8:01 AM - Draco Malfoy: (Bad joke)
11/7/17, 8:01 AM - Draco Malfoy: Unless you‚Äôre not registered in which case, bill should work but you may not even need it. You vote by affidavit or something
11/7/17, 8:02 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Word I‚Äôll scope it out
11/7/17, 8:02 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Jrd I'm registered at my old polling place in Chinatown, Do u know if I can vote in bed stuy if I just bring a bill?
11/7/17, 8:03 AM - Draco Malfoy: You don‚Äôt even need a bill, I don‚Äôt think
11/7/17, 8:03 AM - Draco Malfoy: But you mghtt as well bring it
11/7/17, 8:04 AM - Draco Malfoy: I‚Äôm pretty sure just go to the people at the front and tell them and then you vote by affidavit
11/7/17, 8:04 AM - Seamus Finnigan: What is dat like " I swear I live here"
11/7/17, 8:05 AM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah
11/7/17, 8:06 AM - Draco Malfoy: Pretty sure but someone can help you and you can def vote
11/7/17, 8:12 AM - Seamus Finnigan: you should still be registered where you voted last time right?
11/7/17, 8:13 AM - Rubeus Hagrid: Yeah you don't need anything
11/7/17, 8:14 AM - Draco Malfoy: Yes, unless you updated your registration, you‚Äôre still registered there
11/7/17, 8:55 AM - Minerva McGonagall: My I voted sticker reminds me too much of our selfies last year üò≠
11/7/17, 8:55 AM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah it was triggering going to vote
11/7/17, 8:55 AM - Penelope Clearwater: Dude. It will be one year tomorrow
11/7/17, 8:55 AM - Penelope Clearwater: I'm shook
11/7/17, 8:56 AM - Seamus Finnigan: I've basically been in a state of deep depression since then.
11/7/17, 8:57 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Maybe today can mark a new Chapter
11/7/17, 8:57 AM - Seamus Finnigan: I can't wait to never hear the words president trump on the radio again
11/7/17, 9:03 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Vote Jabari for city council if you‚Äôre in the district for It!
11/7/17, 9:03 AM - Draco Malfoy: My city council race had only one candidate ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
11/7/17, 9:03 AM - Draco Malfoy: But he‚Äôs fine, I don‚Äôt hate him
11/7/17, 9:30 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Voted by affedavit in my new neighborhood. Thx jared.
11/7/17, 9:30 AM - Seamus Finnigan: <Media omitted>
11/7/17, 9:30 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Didn't need Id or anything
11/7/17, 9:31 AM - Draco Malfoy: Nice. Was it easy?
11/7/17, 9:31 AM - Seamus Finnigan: All the women working the polls called me "baby" the whole time
11/7/17, 9:32 AM - Seamus Finnigan: "Alright baby just fill this out"
11/7/17, 9:32 AM - Seamus Finnigan: It was great
11/7/17, 9:32 AM - Draco Malfoy: Haha amazing
11/7/17, 9:32 AM - Seamus Finnigan: U know this only child loves being coddled like that
11/7/17, 9:33 AM - Draco Malfoy: üòÇ
11/7/17, 9:33 AM - Draco Malfoy: Is it rude to ask if you conconconed or proconconed
11/7/17, 9:34 AM - Rubeus Hagrid: I'm more curious about the forest proposition...
11/7/17, 9:36 AM - Draco Malfoy: From my research it‚Äôs not actually a scam but a legit thing that upstate towns need
11/7/17, 9:37 AM - Seamus Finnigan: I said nay to the forest thing
11/7/17, 9:37 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Slippery slope
11/7/17, 9:37 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Don't touch those trees
11/7/17, 9:38 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Despite feeling like I did my research I still had to guess or leave some things blank
11/7/17, 9:39 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Didn't study enough for this multiple choice exam
11/7/17, 9:39 AM - Draco Malfoy: On what, like judges?
11/7/17, 9:39 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Yea
11/7/17, 9:39 AM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah I mean the primaries are more important for those
11/7/17, 9:41 AM - Draco Malfoy: It‚Äôs hard to know who to vote for other than party which is why the parties control the judges

11/15/17, 10:21 PM - Draco Malfoy: Art can impart physical value
11/15/17, 10:24 PM - Rubeus Hagrid: Watching this bball game is attracting my attention
11/15/17, 10:25 PM - Draco Malfoy: Bball could arguably qualify as art so mikes def holds true for that.
11/15/17, 10:26 PM - Draco Malfoy: But like fashion or food can be art.
11/15/17, 10:26 PM - Rubeus Hagrid: Meh, everything is arguably something

11/15/17, 10:30 PM - Draco Malfoy: Makeup can be an art
11/15/17, 10:30 PM - Draco Malfoy: Statues are physical
11/15/17, 10:30 PM - Draco Malfoy: What r I talking about
11/15/17, 10:30 PM - Severus Snape: Use-value
11/15/17, 10:31 PM - Draco Malfoy: Furniture can be art
11/15/17, 10:31 PM - Severus Snape: Craft

11/15/17, 10:33 PM - Minerva McGonagall: A cathedral is a work of art
11/15/17, 10:33 PM - Minerva McGonagall: And has a use
11/15/17, 10:35 PM - Severus Snape: In itself not art. Artistic elements with no use-value on their own
11/15/17, 10:35 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Or any reliquary you ding bat
11/15/17, 10:36 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Or an illuminated manuscript

11/15/17, 10:49 PM - Draco Malfoy: MichAel I think I understand your point but I think it‚Äôs hard to parse elements of design like that. You have to assess objects in their entirety.
11/15/17, 10:49 PM - Draco Malfoy: Gnight ü§´
11/16/17, 7:30 AM - Hermione Granger: I'm more with Mike on this one. Will be a fun argument !

11/17/17, 1:21 PM - Minerva McGonagall: but isnt the joke that cosmic level is always idiotic?
11/17/17, 1:24 PM - Severus Snape: Don't care. I'm stuck at too low level. I just said anxiety to myself for 10 minutes out loud before the doorbell rang

11/28/17, 1:09 PM - Severus Snape: Yo that's interesting
11/28/17, 1:14 PM - Draco Malfoy: very meat is murder
11/28/17, 1:17 PM - Severus Snape: I canonized Luke's behavior before I watched things with critical analysis. I see what he's saying very much and I wonder if kirshner would counter that this was pre-yoda therefore necessary to show unwoke yet powerful Luke
11/28/17, 1:30 PM - Luna Lovegood: see thats why i found it interesting
11/28/17, 1:30 PM - Luna Lovegood: the womp rats makes total sense but the snow monster...
11/28/17, 1:31 PM - Luna Lovegood: it is good representation that he had made a decision to follow a path and was basically treading water with obi wan being gone
11/28/17, 1:31 PM - Penelope Clearwater: i remember that scene feeling icky to me as a kid
11/28/17, 1:31 PM - Luna Lovegood: i just remember being so stoked when he got the saber
11/28/17, 1:31 PM - Draco Malfoy: i thought the snow monster was evil, as a kid. like the T-rex in Jurassic Park.
11/28/17, 1:31 PM - Luna Lovegood: so tense
11/28/17, 1:31 PM - Luna Lovegood: me too
11/28/17, 1:31 PM - Severus Snape: Me too
11/28/17, 1:32 PM - Draco Malfoy: But it's a good point that it isn't evil.
11/28/17, 1:32 PM - Draco Malfoy: Cuz the T-rex was only evil because it was a mistake for humans to try to create one on their own.
11/28/17, 1:33 PM - Draco Malfoy: Wasn't that scene hastily arranged bc of his car accident?
11/28/17, 1:33 PM - Severus Snape: Anything tryna get the protag seemed evil to me as a kid
11/28/17, 1:34 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Yeah as a kid I was like oh good he escaped the scary monster and didn‚Äôt think any more about it
11/28/17, 1:34 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Also actors rarely have any worthwhile insight into decisions made...
11/28/17, 1:35 PM - Draco Malfoy: unless you're daniel day lewis: https://www.wmagazine.com/story/exclusive-daniel-day-lewis-giving-up-acting-phantom-thread

11/28/17, 1:38 PM - Minerva McGonagall: The q and a moderator was this horrible giggling muppet boy so it was a bit of a wasted opportunity
11/28/17, 1:39 PM - Severus Snape: Standard
11/28/17, 1:39 PM - Minerva McGonagall: The only time they actually started discussing something interesting he cut them off with another stupid question
11/28/17, 1:39 PM - Minerva McGonagall: This one was next level though
11/28/17, 1:41 PM - Severus Snape: What happens when a generation of bloggers gets no training on critical responsibility and thinks writing is a good excuse to get in close proximity to famous people
11/28/17, 1:42 PM - Penelope Clearwater: dannnnggg
11/28/17, 1:42 PM - Minerva McGonagall: He also fit into a trend where he‚Äôd ask men about their craft and women about like what their characters felt in specific scenes
11/28/17, 1:43 PM - Minerva McGonagall: To which the only answer is to describe the scene...
11/28/17, 1:43 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Pretty bad
11/28/17, 1:43 PM - Severus Snape: What woman was up there?
11/28/17, 1:43 PM - Draco Malfoy: what is the moderator's name
11/28/17, 1:43 PM - Draco Malfoy: i want to check out his twitter
11/28/17, 1:43 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Like fat giggly curling haired sycophant?
11/28/17, 1:43 PM - Draco Malfoy: lololol
11/28/17, 1:44 PM - Minerva McGonagall: I don‚Äôt actually know how to find his name
11/28/17, 1:45 PM - Minerva McGonagall: He‚Äôs probably someone‚Äôs stupid nephew who received a thrown bone
11/28/17, 1:45 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Bc the bigger screening was right after
11/28/17, 1:49 PM - Draco Malfoy: are you all going to CMBYN tonight?

11/28/17, 9:37 PM - Rubeus Hagrid: I could watch jack black saying 2000 mile zoom lens forever
11/28/17, 9:38 PM - Minerva McGonagall: I think that‚Äôs pretty achievable I bet the dvd is reasonably priced
11/28/17, 9:41 PM - Seamus Finnigan: This scene traumatized me the first time I saw it
11/28/17, 9:41 PM - Seamus Finnigan: The sheer brutality
11/28/17, 9:41 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Very unsettling
11/28/17, 10:05 PM - Draco Malfoy: I thought you meant you wanted to emulate BWs ‚Äúdon‚Äôt touch that
11/29/17, 8:54 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Have any of you ever got a ‚Äòservice battery‚Äô warning on your Mac?

11/29/17, 8:57 AM - Minerva McGonagall: noticed bc my battery drained in like an hour last night then i saw warning
11/29/17, 8:57 AM - Draco Malfoy: 5 yr old battery is old
11/29/17, 8:57 AM - Minerva McGonagall: daaaaaang
11/29/17, 8:57 AM - Draco Malfoy: They‚Äôre meant to last like 3 years
11/29/17, 8:57 AM - Draco Malfoy: But some had recalls so you could see if apple has a replacement plan
11/29/17, 8:58 AM - Draco Malfoy: But they generally have a limited number of cycles
11/29/17, 8:58 AM - Minerva McGonagall: so just call apple and see whats up - at this point is it worth replacing or should I just get a new computer b/c everything will start to die
11/29/17, 8:58 AM - Minerva McGonagall: yeah apple says 1000, mine is at 780
11/29/17, 9:00 AM - Draco Malfoy: That sucks. You could probably buy a 3rd party battery kit and watch a YouTube video to install it

Since we are all around the same age, it could be a cool study of the roles that may have influenced our lives.

11/30/17, 10:45 AM - Draco Malfoy: I think there is less concern among congressional democrats v. Health bill etc bc Rs HAVE to pass this bill or they‚Äôll lose their donors, but it‚Äôs going to be so unpopular that dems should be able to campaign against it in 18 and 20
11/30/17, 10:46 AM - Draco Malfoy: The problem is the bill does provide short term tax reductions for most ppl
11/30/17, 10:46 AM - Minerva McGonagall: No way we get rid of the lower corporate tax
11/30/17, 10:46 AM - Draco Malfoy: Until about 2020

12/8/17, 9:48 AM - Minerva McGonagall: ew that would have been so weird
12/8/17, 10:40 AM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah would‚Äôve been bizarre
12/8/17, 10:40 AM - Draco Malfoy: Did you like it
12/8/17, 10:52 AM - Minerva McGonagall: yeah I enjoyed the film - I liked it a lot for what it didn't do, i.e. a queer movie where shame is not a major driving emotion, where parents judgement is not a major problem. I thought it was mostly nicely shot though there were some weird like 1 second jump cuts that I found distracting. it felt akin to those classic summer romance movies where not much actually happens but its about a vibe and a feeling which it did well
12/8/17, 10:52 AM - Minerva McGonagall: mostly just made me jealous that people could have parents that good lol
12/8/17, 10:53 AM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah had the same thoughts
12/8/17, 10:53 AM - Minerva McGonagall: like a queer my summer with monika which is fun
12/8/17, 10:56 AM - Minerva McGonagall: all in all Id put it on par with ladybird - as like very solid films that aren't doing much exciting cinematically but are presenting a world well, are well written, and stand our more in terms character and writing than cinematic directing
12/8/17, 10:56 AM - Draco Malfoy: The stuhlbarg scene towards the end is pretty nuts
12/8/17, 10:56 AM - Draco Malfoy: Still need to see ladybird
12/8/17, 10:57 AM - Minerva McGonagall: yeah that got me choked up for sure

12/8/17, 10:57 AM - Minerva McGonagall: he was probably shooting this or something lol
12/8/17, 10:59 AM - Draco Malfoy: Wow üò≤
12/8/17, 11:00 AM - Minerva McGonagall: ladybird is worth seeing for sure
12/8/17, 11:00 AM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah ganna see it soon hopefully
12/8/17, 11:00 AM - Minerva McGonagall: i'm mostly excited about I, Tonya now which I really wanted to see last night but my back was fucked

12/11/17, 5:16 PM - Hermione Granger: Even though when they wrote the script it could have been undecided
12/11/17, 5:17 PM - Draco Malfoy: Well prequels make that not work. Because Obi-wan would definitely have known about Leia.
12/11/17, 5:17 PM - Hermione Granger: The prequels basically out of the canon at this point I feel
12/11/17, 5:17 PM - Hermione Granger: lol
12/11/17, 5:17 PM - Luna Lovegood: Jared is right tho
12/11/17, 5:18 PM - Luna Lovegood: i think prequels are non-canon
12/11/17, 5:18 PM - Hermione Granger: Well maybe yoda and obi wan just had a difference of opinion üòâ
12/11/17, 5:18 PM - Draco Malfoy: i mean there are endless prequel plot holes
12/11/17, 5:18 PM - Luna Lovegood: they are strictly hypothetical
12/11/17, 5:18 PM - Hermione Granger: Lol
12/11/17, 5:18 PM - Draco Malfoy: obi-wan would've recognized those droids
12/11/17, 5:18 PM - Luna Lovegood: he does
12/11/17, 5:18 PM - Hermione Granger: Maybe obi was sexist
12/11/17, 5:18 PM - Luna Lovegood: "I don't seem to remember ever 'owning' a droid"
12/11/17, 5:19 PM - Luna Lovegood: he knew who they were
12/11/17, 5:19 PM - Draco Malfoy: fair enough
12/11/17, 5:19 PM - Luna Lovegood: Plus. that old wizard had been living in sand people territory for too long
12/11/17, 5:19 PM - Luna Lovegood: he's crazy
12/11/17, 5:20 PM - Draco Malfoy: I think "there is another" comment was just a set up for Luke and Leia being siblings and Lucas hadn't really thought much further about it than that.
12/11/17, 5:21 PM - Luna Lovegood: <Media omitted>
12/11/17, 5:22 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Yeah it just meant there is another Skywalker(leia)
12/11/17, 5:23 PM - Draco Malfoy: I don't think Lucas realized that Leia was Darth Vader's daughter when he made A New Hope
12/11/17, 5:23 PM - Draco Malfoy: like, I think the idea came later.
12/11/17, 5:23 PM - Minerva McGonagall: There is another line is from empire
12/11/17, 5:23 PM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah
12/11/17, 5:23 PM - Luna Lovegood: You guys
12/11/17, 5:23 PM - Luna Lovegood: If any of yall go to austin
12/11/17, 5:23 PM - Draco Malfoy: I think he came up with the idea when plotting the next 2 movies
12/11/17, 5:24 PM - Minerva McGonagall: But no he didn‚Äôt decide they were siblings yet for sure
12/11/17, 5:24 PM - Luna Lovegood: you have to visit this place:
12/11/17, 5:24 PM - Luna Lovegood: https://saharalounge.com/
12/11/17, 5:24 PM - Luna Lovegood: Also, who's idea was it to make the force users haves telepathic and telekinetic powers
12/11/17, 5:24 PM - Luna Lovegood: bc in anh it's just mind tricks and voice manipulation
12/11/17, 5:24 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Maxi bombad the force

12/11/17, 5:27 PM - Draco Malfoy: i cant watch with sound on
12/11/17, 5:28 PM - Minerva McGonagall: All these years later jar jar is the best part of the prequels
12/11/17, 5:28 PM - Draco Malfoy: if you watch it thinking he's evil sith, it makes more sense
12/11/17, 5:28 PM - Luna Lovegood: i love that
12/11/17, 5:28 PM - Luna Lovegood: i mean he
12/11/17, 5:28 PM - Luna Lovegood: he is the only part ppl talk about anymore
12/11/17, 5:28 PM - Minerva McGonagall: The prequels only got worse as Lucas got scared and cut him out
12/11/17, 5:28 PM - Draco Malfoy: yeah
12/11/17, 5:29 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Bc everything else was SO lifeless that you could really feel the emptiness after that
12/11/17, 5:29 PM - Draco Malfoy: i agree with that completely
12/11/17, 5:29 PM - Severus Snape: you people disgust me
12/11/17, 5:29 PM - Draco Malfoy: why
12/11/17, 5:29 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Damn thought I was gunna get a lot of push back on that hot take

12/11/17, 5:30 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Pretty proud of everyone cept that dincompoop Michael
12/11/17, 5:30 PM - Draco Malfoy: but response was so intensely negative they had to change course
12/11/17, 5:30 PM - Minerva McGonagall: For sure
12/11/17, 5:30 PM - Draco Malfoy: first CGI character, right? it was like a big deal
12/11/17, 5:32 PM - Draco Malfoy: or one of the first
12/11/17, 5:33 PM - Seamus Finnigan: I can rly relate to jar jar
12/11/17, 5:33 PM - Seamus Finnigan: He was the only character that was believable
12/11/17, 5:33 PM - Draco Malfoy: he was ahead of his time.
12/11/17, 5:34 PM - Draco Malfoy: i would be extremely happy if Snoke was Jar Jar
12/11/17, 5:34 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Won‚Äôt happen but I‚Äôd be down
12/11/17, 5:34 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Even though he feels like some poorly done racial stereotype
12/11/17, 5:35 PM - Minerva McGonagall: The fate of jar jar in Disney canon is he gets banished from Naboo and ends up being a beggar slash street performer that everyone hates
12/11/17, 5:35 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Look it up
12/11/17, 5:35 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Well Ege that includes every alien in episode 1

12/11/17, 5:38 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Someone needs to pitch a Star Wars story film that is like a raging thunder type racing movie about the pod racing circuit
12/11/17, 5:38 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Holy shit I‚Äôm a genius
12/11/17, 5:38 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Michael is getting furious bc he thinks revenge of the sith is legit good

12/11/17, 5:40 PM - Minerva McGonagall: ‚ÄúI have the high ground you cannot win‚Äù ‚Äúthat depends on your definition!‚Äù
12/11/17, 5:40 PM - Luna Lovegood: Or the birth scene when she names them and it's like an assembly line of babies

12/11/17, 5:42 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Sorta looks like Liam nielsons
12/11/17, 5:43 PM - Draco Malfoy: i mean you are adding to the argument that the jedi are the villains in the overall story arc
12/11/17, 5:43 PM - Minerva McGonagall: It‚Äôll probably just be like a boba fett clone bc everything in Star Wars ends up being a boba fett clone
12/11/17, 5:43 PM - Minerva McGonagall: ‚ÄúIn my opinion it is the Jedi who are evil‚Äù
12/11/17, 5:44 PM - Draco Malfoy: but like, he's right.
12/11/17, 5:44 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Totes
12/11/17, 5:44 PM - Seamus Finnigan: This is some alt right opinions
12/11/17, 5:44 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Jedi deserves to fall

12/11/17, 5:44 PM - Seamus Finnigan: That‚Äôs what the alt right would say
12/11/17, 5:45 PM - Hermione Granger: But don't think I can do ep 1
12/11/17, 5:45 PM - Hermione Granger: Even though a part of me likes it more than FA
12/11/17, 5:45 PM - Minerva McGonagall: I didn‚Äôt vote for any Jedi
12/11/17, 5:45 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Who made them king
12/11/17, 5:46 PM - Severus Snape: lol
12/11/17, 5:46 PM - Draco Malfoy: i mean i guess maybe the jedi are actually like the FBI / mueller probe.
12/11/17, 5:46 PM - Draco Malfoy: well let's hope not.
12/11/17, 5:47 PM - Minerva McGonagall: I mean they raised an army by like randomly buying a million boba fetts that like they know an evil person ordered
12/11/17, 5:47 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Doesn‚Äôt seem like there‚Äôs a lot of critical thinking
12/11/17, 5:48 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Also if they‚Äôre so good how do they excuse using clones as an eternal soldier class w no rights or choice
12/11/17, 5:49 PM - Hermione Granger: Maybe the clones aren't conscious at all
12/11/17, 5:49 PM - Hermione Granger: They are zombie essentially
12/11/17, 5:50 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Except we see them use critical tactical thinking
12/11/17, 5:50 PM - Minerva McGonagall: I think it‚Äôs pretty fucked up
12/11/17, 5:50 PM - Hermione Granger: That's how they appear
12/11/17, 5:50 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Just as bad as the republics refusal to give droids rights

12/13/17, 12:21 PM - Hermione Granger: Are you tripping right now ?
12/13/17, 12:24 PM - Penelope Clearwater: <Media omitted>
12/13/17, 12:33 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Imagine eating soup
12/13/17, 12:34 PM - Minerva McGonagall: It runs off the spoon and down your beard in salty rivulets
12/13/17, 12:34 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Soup is flavored mud
12/13/17, 12:35 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Exactly! Ege gets me

12/13/17, 12:44 PM - Hermione Granger: ?
12/13/17, 12:45 PM - Minerva McGonagall: It‚Äôs disgustingness scales w it‚Äôs thickness
12/13/17, 12:45 PM - Minerva McGonagall: If it‚Äôs thick enough it isn‚Äôt as gross
12/13/17, 12:50 PM - Hermione Granger: lol
12/13/17, 12:51 PM - Hermione Granger: I mean I guess a meat broth is basically hot bone juice
12/13/17, 12:52 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Thin white soups are the grossest
12/13/17, 12:52 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Tomato soup at least it‚Äôs like oh I‚Äôm just drinking smushed tomatoes
12/13/17, 12:52 PM - Minerva McGonagall: I think spoon size is a factor. Deeper the spoon w less run off is preferable
12/13/17, 12:53 PM - Hermione Granger: What about the medieval times spoon/bowl
12/13/17, 12:53 PM - Hermione Granger: ?
12/13/17, 12:54 PM - Minerva McGonagall: I think that made soup less disgusting.
12/13/17, 12:54 PM - Minerva McGonagall: It kind of pushed it both ways but tricky to figure out the net change
12/13/17, 1:09 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Did u guys use utensils at medieval times

12/13/17, 1:19 PM - Severus Snape: Something can be both good and conceptually disgusting. Like anything involving semen
12/13/17, 1:19 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Chowder is good
12/13/17, 1:19 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Soup dumplings are amazing but unbelievably disgusting
12/13/17, 1:19 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Mmmm
12/13/17, 1:20 PM - Minerva McGonagall: You‚Äôre tearing holes in little dough balls to suck the oil out. Sounds more like a date w Apolon than a meal

12/13/17, 1:24 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Yeah but I‚Äôm not talking about like when you really dig into it
12/13/17, 1:24 PM - Draco Malfoy: Oh yeah
12/13/17, 1:24 PM - Minerva McGonagall: Like chicken nuggets are less disgusting than soup. Even though the process of making them is gross
12/13/17, 1:24 PM - Draco Malfoy: True they‚Äôre like perfect food shape
12/13/17, 2:12 PM - Rubeus Hagrid: That pink slime
12/13/17, 2:32 PM - Hermione Granger: Or conceivably, "deep fried chicken p√¢t√©"

1/2/18, 9:00 AM - Minerva McGonagall: worst book best movie
1/2/18, 9:00 AM - Minerva McGonagall: cept 3 is actually probably better but still
1/2/18, 9:01 AM - Hermione Granger: Hahaha
1/2/18, 9:01 AM - Hermione Granger: I was blown away
1/2/18, 9:01 AM - Minerva McGonagall: its just them getting fucked up on butter beer and flirting

1/2/18, 9:01 AM - Hermione Granger: And they completely nailed teenage romance
1/2/18, 9:01 AM - Hermione Granger: Like better than a John Hughes movie
1/2/18, 9:01 AM - Minerva McGonagall: yeah lol
1/2/18, 9:01 AM - Hermione Granger: The whole thing is about drugs and fucking
1/2/18, 9:01 AM - Minerva McGonagall: I know its great

1/2/18, 9:02 AM - Minerva McGonagall: and slughorn
1/2/18, 9:02 AM - Hermione Granger: Even the first scene where Harry is about to bang that hot waitress
1/2/18, 9:02 AM - Minerva McGonagall: omg yeah
1/2/18, 9:02 AM - Minerva McGonagall: 5 is really strong too but mostly bc the whole ministry sequence is stunning - the rest of the movie is fine but building up to that
1/2/18, 9:03 AM - Minerva McGonagall: its a bummer 4 is so fucking bad or you'd have 3,5,6 all good in a row
1/2/18, 9:03 AM - Hermione Granger: And when dumbldore just created a fire bomb in the cave
1/2/18, 9:03 AM - Hermione Granger: Yeah I don't need to see Robert Pattinson

1/2/18, 9:06 AM - Minerva McGonagall: oh damn
1/2/18, 9:10 AM - Hermione Granger: In 6, where they are at slughorns dinner party eating like 15 pounds of  profiteroles and they are all trashed
1/2/18, 9:10 AM - Hermione Granger: Oh and when Harry takes the liquid luck and is walking around just coked out of his mind
1/2/18, 9:10 AM - Severus Snape: Stop trying to Trump away the fact that you're the one that changes ur mind and supports weird old shit (ep1, anti lotr)
1/2/18, 9:11 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Oh yeah üòÇ
1/2/18, 9:11 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Ep1 is best prequel everyone agrees
1/2/18, 9:11 AM - Minerva McGonagall: It‚Äôs like an unchallenged opinion
1/2/18, 9:11 AM - Hermione Granger: Yeah
1/2/18, 9:11 AM - Severus Snape: Ok Donald
1/2/18, 9:12 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Lol we already went through this and 90% of the chat agreed including Garrett which means 2/3 of our 7th grade Star Wars crew agrees
1/2/18, 9:12 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Everyone but you
1/2/18, 9:13 AM - Hermione Granger: Ep 1 actually has cultural significance as a fluke
1/2/18, 9:13 AM - Hermione Granger: The other 2 are just bad movies
1/2/18, 9:13 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Ep one was the only prequel where lucas wasn't like asleep in a chair as they were making it
1/2/18, 9:14 AM - Hermione Granger: Hahahaha
1/2/18, 9:14 AM - Minerva McGonagall: only prequel that wasnt just shot on a green couch in a green room
1/2/18, 9:14 AM - Draco Malfoy: When episode 3 came out tho everyone was like ‚Äúoh this is a serious movie unlike the others‚Äù. In retrospect, ep 1 is best. I think that‚Äôs ur point, mike?
1/2/18, 9:15 AM - Hermione Granger: (I love how Star Bros just took over bro chat)
1/2/18, 9:15 AM - Minerva McGonagall: lol thats true
1/2/18, 9:16 AM - Draco Malfoy: Lucas was like ‚Äúhey I even had Spielberg direct a scene!!‚Äù
1/2/18, 9:16 AM - Hermione Granger: Hahahaha
1/2/18, 9:22 AM - Penelope Clearwater: What do u guys think about hp 7: part 1? I've always loved it for it's minimalism and sadness
1/2/18, 9:23 AM - Penelope Clearwater: Especially between Ron and Hermione. Seeing their relationship be tested in a mature aay
1/2/18, 9:23 AM - Penelope Clearwater: Way
1/2/18, 9:24 AM - Minerva McGonagall: I'd have to rewatch, i def liked it more than 1. i remember my problems with it and they feel pretty minor in retrospect. I like the idea of them just hiding in the woods lotr style...
1/2/18, 9:24 AM - Minerva McGonagall: the Ron Hermione relationship just never made sense to me but i think if i just give in to it it'd be chill
1/2/18, 9:25 AM - Penelope Clearwater: Yea I mean it's a bit too classic of a foil
1/2/18, 9:25 AM - Minerva McGonagall: *more than part 2 i meant
1/2/18, 9:25 AM - Penelope Clearwater: Yea part two was a mess
1/2/18, 9:25 AM - Minerva McGonagall: hermione is like this genius, in control person and Ron is unable to like get dressed without help
1/2/18, 9:29 AM - Rubeus Hagrid: How do you guys feel about Jude Law playing a young Dumbledore in the next Fantastic Beasts?

1/2/18, 9:31 AM - Penelope Clearwater: i hope he plays it like the young pope
1/2/18, 9:33 AM - Minerva McGonagall: üëç
1/2/18, 9:42 AM - Minerva McGonagall: What‚Äôs interesting about like‚Ä¶ the matrix or Star Wars is that they offer in-universe / universal explanations for magic/super powers.
1/2/18, 9:42 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Compare to Harry Potter which has no explanation, or superheroes which have a different stupid explanation for every hero‚Ä¶ (except X-Men which is a little better)
1/2/18, 9:43 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Star Wars is such a great universe, I'm excited or it to break away from the civil war/skywalkers... what the fuck is going down in the uncharted worlds
1/2/18, 9:47 AM - Penelope Clearwater: <Media omitted>
1/2/18, 9:48 AM - Draco Malfoy: üëÜbeautiful

1/2/18, 9:52 AM - Hermione Granger: Guys the Ron Hermione relationship works because she isn't threatened by Jim
1/2/18, 9:52 AM - Hermione Granger: Him
1/2/18, 9:52 AM - Hermione Granger: If she was with another genius, she would always be competing with him
1/2/18, 9:53 AM - Hermione Granger: And she loves gingers
1/2/18, 9:53 AM - Hermione Granger: Crookshanks was also ginger

1/2/18, 9:54 AM - Minerva McGonagall: i thought he just runs away and shits himself while H solves every problem
1/2/18, 9:54 AM - Hermione Granger: He sacrificed himself a bunch
1/2/18, 9:54 AM - Hermione Granger: When it counts
1/2/18, 9:54 AM - Minerva McGonagall: H=hermione not Harry
1/2/18, 9:54 AM - Penelope Clearwater: you can't ignore the difference in their families... i think hermione yearned for the safety and welcoming nature of his fam
1/2/18, 9:54 AM - Hermione Granger: Help
1/2/18, 9:54 AM - Hermione Granger: Yeeepp
1/2/18, 9:55 AM - Hermione Granger: Sorry, typo

1/2/18, 9:55 AM - Penelope Clearwater: she had to leave her family in the beginning of 7: part 1 and it was heartbreaking
1/2/18, 9:55 AM - Hermione Granger: But approachable at the same time

1/2/18, 9:55 AM - Hermione Granger: That was 6

1/2/18, 11:23 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Get Out most exciting culturally, Good Time most exciting cinematically but flawed, CMBYN and YN made me cry the most, TLJ brought me the most Joy,

1/24/18, 11:51 PM - Seamus Finnigan: But also that movie is horribly sexist and racist
1/24/18, 11:51 PM - Hermione Granger: How did a fucking Austrian guy get in the CIA anyway ?
1/24/18, 11:52 PM - Hermione Granger: Bill Paxton was pure gold tho

1/24/18, 11:54 PM - Seamus Finnigan: Garrett asking the important questions tho

1/26/18, 9:53 AM - Penelope Clearwater: i don't wanna deal with eagles coming to kill me
1/26/18, 9:53 AM - Penelope Clearwater: yea exactly
1/26/18, 9:53 AM - Penelope Clearwater: i think any bro who picks the guy with the gun has too much faith in guns
1/26/18, 9:53 AM - Penelope Clearwater: maybe if it was an automatic
1/26/18, 9:54 AM - Penelope Clearwater: 10000 rats tho... tbh got me scared
1/26/18, 9:55 AM - Penelope Clearwater: but the eags will take care of them
1/26/18, 10:00 AM - Draco Malfoy: Eagles and rats
1/26/18, 10:00 AM - Draco Malfoy: Is the guaranteed winner
1/26/18, 10:01 AM - Draco Malfoy: The only thing that can beat the rats is the eagles
1/26/18, 10:01 AM - Seamus Finnigan: How much damage Can a rat rly do
1/26/18, 10:01 AM - Draco Malfoy: 10,000 rats
1/26/18, 10:01 AM - Seamus Finnigan: They can nibble
1/26/18, 10:01 AM - Seamus Finnigan: 10000 nibbles
1/26/18, 10:01 AM - Draco Malfoy: Can swarm
1/26/18, 10:01 AM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah they have teeth
1/26/18, 10:01 AM - Seamus Finnigan: They‚Äôre not like zerglings they‚Äôre slightly larger mice
1/26/18, 10:01 AM - Draco Malfoy: That‚Äôs like 200,000 teeth
1/26/18, 10:02 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Yea but gorilla skin can withstand most bullets
1/26/18, 10:02 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Lol miles what did you do
1/26/18, 10:05 AM - Penelope Clearwater: i obliterated everyone's friday is what i fucking did
1/26/18, 10:05 AM - Penelope Clearwater: jared... how can you expect rats and eagles to work together!
1/26/18, 10:06 AM - Penelope Clearwater: natural enemies!
1/26/18, 10:06 AM - Draco Malfoy: But they are defending me in this scenario
1/26/18, 10:07 AM - Penelope Clearwater: yea i guess
1/26/18, 10:07 AM - Penelope Clearwater: i guess those are the rules
1/26/18, 10:08 AM - Draco Malfoy: i think the only thing that can defend you against 10,000 rats is eagles
1/26/18, 10:08 AM - Draco Malfoy: 10,000 rats will always win
1/26/18, 10:08 AM - Penelope Clearwater: yea thats why i picked eagles for my team
1/26/18, 10:09 AM - Penelope Clearwater: and i feel like wolves are smart
1/26/18, 10:09 AM - Penelope Clearwater: and work in packs really well
1/26/18, 10:09 AM - Draco Malfoy: yeah but 10,000 rats will kill you in like 5 minutes
1/26/18, 10:09 AM - Draco Malfoy: and 50 eagles can't stop them fast enough
1/26/18, 10:09 AM - Draco Malfoy: none of those things can stop the rats fast enough
1/26/18, 10:09 AM - Draco Malfoy: against a human
1/26/18, 10:09 AM - Penelope Clearwater: i dunno.. i think the rats will get super scared once the eagles start tearing into them
1/26/18, 10:10 AM - Penelope Clearwater: the big question is: how far away are these attackers
1/26/18, 10:10 AM - Draco Malfoy: but in this scenario they would still be attacking you
1/26/18, 10:10 AM - Draco Malfoy: True-- if this is on a huge map it's different than a small map
1/26/18, 10:10 AM - Penelope Clearwater: yea how big is the map
1/26/18, 10:10 AM - Penelope Clearwater: ill ask the guy who posted it on twitter
1/26/18, 10:11 AM - Draco Malfoy: also-- are animals scattered randomly on the map
1/26/18, 10:11 AM - Draco Malfoy: or are they starting in a pack
1/26/18, 10:11 AM - Penelope Clearwater: i assume pack
1/26/18, 10:12 AM - Draco Malfoy: assume nothing
1/26/18, 10:12 AM - Penelope Clearwater: word
1/26/18, 10:13 AM - Penelope Clearwater: still interested in other people's solutions to this problem
1/26/18, 10:13 AM - Seamus Finnigan: I lold so hard
1/26/18, 10:14 AM - Penelope Clearwater: Jared "Assume Nothing" O'Connell
1/26/18, 10:16 AM - Draco Malfoy: <Media omitted>
1/26/18, 10:16 AM - Penelope Clearwater: dang
1/26/18, 10:17 AM - Penelope Clearwater: oh wait.. those are Hawks not eagles
1/26/18, 10:17 AM - Penelope Clearwater: anyway.. i still pick them
1/26/18, 10:20 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Rats on offense Jared is obviously right
1/26/18, 10:20 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Then lions ü¶Å bc the rats will do all the work but I wanna ride around on a lion
1/26/18, 10:20 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Good point will
1/26/18, 10:20 AM - Penelope Clearwater: lol... as long as u are aware that lions won't do shit
1/26/18, 10:20 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Of course
1/26/18, 10:20 AM - Draco Malfoy: but maybe the hawks could hold you and fly
1/26/18, 10:20 AM - Seamus Finnigan: My instinct was gorilla ü¶ç and the gun
1/26/18, 10:20 AM - Draco Malfoy: so you could fly....
1/26/18, 10:20 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Cept like be my legendary mount
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Which would also be the title of this movie
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Penelope Clearwater: right dope mount
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Hawk ain‚Äôt carrying this big boy
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Draco Malfoy: i assumed it was a gunman with a gun, not a gun for you
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Draco Malfoy: but its 50 hawks
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Yea can I get rid the dude
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Yeah idk want some bro petting my animals
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Penelope Clearwater: yea its a bro who has probably only shot a gun like 2 times
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Like oops gotta reload
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Seamus Finnigan: And just keep the gun
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Penelope Clearwater: braguveet
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Also that looks like a slow gun
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Penelope Clearwater: yea no upgrades
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Gotta reload every shot
1/26/18, 10:21 AM - Penelope Clearwater: no smoke
1/26/18, 10:22 AM - Seamus Finnigan: That‚Äôs no good
1/26/18, 10:22 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Rats will be down to the bone before he gets off two shots
1/26/18, 10:22 AM - Penelope Clearwater: ok.. im starting to get into the rats
1/26/18, 10:22 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Also like every other one you know when you‚Äôve confirmed the kill
1/26/18, 10:22 AM - Penelope Clearwater: dang true
1/26/18, 10:22 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Rats it‚Äôs like well I killed rats all day I bet I got them all
1/26/18, 10:23 AM - Penelope Clearwater: then a rat comes for ur neck
1/26/18, 10:23 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Then the remaining 9900 eat you in your sleep
1/26/18, 10:23 AM - Minerva McGonagall: It‚Äôs like impossible to kill 10000 of anything
1/26/18, 10:24 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Can u rly imagine 10,000 rats killing all those other animals
1/26/18, 10:24 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Rats only work if you have eagles too
1/26/18, 10:24 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Bc otherwise eagles will pick off all the rats
1/26/18, 10:24 AM - Seamus Finnigan: But like, wolves eat rats for breakfast
1/26/18, 10:24 AM - Penelope Clearwater: jared was right
1/26/18, 10:25 AM - Penelope Clearwater: as fucking always
1/26/18, 10:25 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Wolves are rly good at killing rats
1/26/18, 10:25 AM - Penelope Clearwater: but the number 10000 is staggering
1/26/18, 10:25 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Lol wolves eat like 7 rats and are like k I did it nap time
1/26/18, 10:26 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Then get eaten by rats
1/26/18, 10:26 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Plays out the same every time
1/26/18, 10:26 AM - Seamus Finnigan: You guys are really underestimating the motivation of these characters
1/26/18, 10:26 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Why do you think rats would be any more voracious than a wolf
1/26/18, 10:26 AM - Minerva McGonagall: You can‚Äôt beat rats no one can
1/26/18, 10:26 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Bc they‚Äôre rats!
1/26/18, 10:26 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Rats eat shit just for fun
1/26/18, 10:26 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Wolves only do for food
1/26/18, 10:27 AM - Minerva McGonagall: And if you have 10k they‚Äôre always gunna be hungry
1/26/18, 10:27 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Yea but this is offense defense kill time not snacktime
1/26/18, 10:27 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Wolves get full and sleepy
1/26/18, 10:27 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Hunger isn‚Äôt a factor!! They ain‚Äôt eating just killing!
1/26/18, 10:27 AM - Minerva McGonagall: So they keep pounding 5 hour energy???
1/26/18, 10:27 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Like eat 1 rat pet 100 killed prob
1/26/18, 10:27 AM - Minerva McGonagall: An alpha predator uses all its energy making a kill
1/26/18, 10:27 AM - Minerva McGonagall: It can‚Äôt just keep killing
1/26/18, 10:28 AM - Seamus Finnigan: That seems Efficient
1/26/18, 10:28 AM - Penelope Clearwater: i see ege's point... there's not a ton of info in this scenario... but because of the lack of info, i think we can assume that the two you pick will defend you until the end
1/26/18, 10:28 AM - Minerva McGonagall: But once they fall asleep...
1/26/18, 10:28 AM - Penelope Clearwater: i know we should never assume. but we need to put constraints on the scenario
1/26/18, 10:28 AM - Minerva McGonagall: It‚Äôs like hunger games
1/26/18, 10:28 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Lol why are wolves the only sleepy animal
1/26/18, 10:28 AM - Minerva McGonagall: You gotta sleep
1/26/18, 10:28 AM - Penelope Clearwater: wolves are sleepy lol
1/26/18, 10:28 AM - Minerva McGonagall: And when you sleep the gnawing maw of the rats comes to greet you
1/26/18, 10:29 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Wolves are 2nd most sleepy after lions
1/26/18, 10:30 AM - Penelope Clearwater: that bro wit a gun is 3rd
1/26/18, 10:30 AM - Rubeus Hagrid: I'm a sleepy bear today
1/26/18, 10:30 AM - Penelope Clearwater: i guess it all comes down to who is the sleepiest
1/26/18, 10:30 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Rats sleep too
1/26/18, 10:30 AM - Draco Malfoy: the rats can just tag team and take naps
1/26/18, 10:31 AM - Draco Malfoy: and still keep like 8000 in play
1/26/18, 10:31 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Exactly J
1/26/18, 10:31 AM - Draco Malfoy: and none of those can kill more than like 20-30 rats per minute
1/26/18, 10:31 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Exactly
1/26/18, 10:31 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Unbeatable
1/26/18, 10:31 AM - Minerva McGonagall: You could also cover yourself in living rat armor 10 rats thick
1/26/18, 10:32 AM - Minerva McGonagall: And just roll around in a living rat ball
1/26/18, 10:32 AM - Seamus Finnigan: A gorilla can just stomp around and kill 20-30 rats per second
1/26/18, 10:32 AM - Penelope Clearwater: sleepiest ranking
1. lions
2. wolves
3. bro with a gun
4. bears (james)
5. water buff
6. gorilla
7. crocs
8. hawks
9. rat
1/26/18, 10:32 AM - Minerva McGonagall: No way
1/26/18, 10:32 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Too slow rats scurry
1/26/18, 10:32 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Hahahhaha
1/26/18, 10:32 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Or did you forget that
1/26/18, 10:33 AM - Penelope Clearwater: rats scurry... still need a dictionary
1/26/18, 10:33 AM - Seamus Finnigan: this convo has delayed me leaving the house for 15 mins
1/26/18, 10:33 AM - Penelope Clearwater: haha yuss

1/26/18, 10:33 AM - Minerva McGonagall: I gotta go too
1/26/18, 10:33 AM - Penelope Clearwater: still waitin on mike to weigh in
1/26/18, 10:33 AM - Penelope Clearwater: / rest of the bro chat
1/26/18, 10:36 AM - Rubeus Hagrid: I'd picks rats and crocs to protect, I like a good jump snap against the hawks and rats can't defeat crocs so I need them on my side
1/26/18, 10:36 AM - Seamus Finnigan: It‚Äôs true crocs Skin so thick
1/26/18, 10:36 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Ok I‚Äôm leaving the house
1/26/18, 10:36 AM - Penelope Clearwater: yea.. interesting how the skin of a croc factors in
1/26/18, 10:36 AM - Penelope Clearwater: ege ur never leaving
1/26/18, 10:37 AM - Seamus Finnigan: I‚Äôm trapped this is the most exciting thing I‚Äôve gotta so today
1/26/18, 10:37 AM - Draco Malfoy: I think I could take the Croc myself, tbh
1/26/18, 10:37 AM - Penelope Clearwater: and james, when i read jump snap... i pictured u standing on the top of the crocs mouth... then the croc snaps open his mouth launching you into the air to kill the hawk
1/26/18, 10:37 AM - Draco Malfoy: just have a handful of rats to help out if i get in trouble
1/26/18, 10:37 AM - Seamus Finnigan: The rats could crawl into the crocs body
1/26/18, 10:37 AM - Seamus Finnigan: And eat it from the inside
1/26/18, 10:38 AM - Penelope Clearwater: ooooo
1/26/18, 10:38 AM - Seamus Finnigan: When he takes a bite he gets a couple of whole ones
1/26/18, 10:38 AM - Draco Malfoy: true!
1/26/18, 10:38 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Death from inside
1/26/18, 10:38 AM - Seamus Finnigan: Fuck the rats are pretty good
1/26/18, 10:38 AM - Seamus Finnigan: So versatile
1/26/18, 10:39 AM - Rubeus Hagrid: Damn you're right!
1/26/18, 10:39 AM - Penelope Clearwater: what about the Rat King problem
1/26/18, 10:40 AM - Penelope Clearwater: u get that many rats together.. they are gonna get all tangled... maybe reduce their effectiveness
1/26/18, 10:40 AM - Draco Malfoy: i thought the rat king is a good thing
1/26/18, 10:41 AM - Penelope Clearwater: it could prevent them from moving as freely
1/26/18, 10:41 AM - Penelope Clearwater: might make it easier for a gorilla to stomp em out
1/26/18, 10:46 AM - Draco Malfoy: i guess that raises the question of what your influence is over the animals-- they're already doing something against their natural instincts. so, like, how exactly have they been "rewired" and will they still revert to certain natural instincts? which ones?
1/26/18, 10:47 AM - Penelope Clearwater: seems like a cool little video game idea
1/26/18, 10:48 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Also we forget that rats can breed the fastest by far
1/26/18, 10:49 AM - Minerva McGonagall: So if this becomes a protracted siege they can bolster their numbers bc they can breed like... rats
1/26/18, 10:49 AM - Draco Malfoy: oh true-- if the map is large enough this could go on for a long enough time for breeding to take place.
1/26/18, 10:59 AM - Hermione Granger: 183 texts my bros...

1/26/18, 3:40 PM - Severus Snape: Y'all wildly underestimating the ability of the Hunter on offense to snipe your ass
1/26/18, 3:43 PM - Hermione Granger: But he will be outnumbered
1/26/18, 3:43 PM - Hermione Granger: By all the other animals
1/26/18, 3:43 PM - Hermione Granger: He can't be on your team
1/26/18, 3:44 PM - Severus Snape: There's no second place. Live or die. You've all seen jumanji
1/26/18, 5:53 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Guys got no scope
1/26/18, 5:58 PM - Minerva McGonagall: He won‚Äôt be able to hit me through my rat armor

1/26/18, 6:07 PM - Draco Malfoy: Are there natural obstacles/hiding places
1/26/18, 6:43 PM - Penelope Clearwater: It takes place at the Bronx zoo. The zoo has all these animals. And the rats live in Manhattan.
1/26/18, 6:44 PM - Penelope Clearwater: So if u pick the rats, u gotta wait for all 10000 to get to the Bronx.
1/26/18, 6:44 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Some are already in the Bronx but only 2000

2/7/18, 10:50 AM - Draco Malfoy: oh yeah that could create some competition
2/7/18, 10:50 AM - Minerva McGonagall: i need a weed that makes me do fun things instead of makes me eat pizza and fall asleep

2/7/18, 10:53 AM - Penelope Clearwater: Hit me up with any data points u want and I'll try to code them
2/7/18, 10:54 AM - Seamus Finnigan: for word-count
2/7/18, 10:54 AM - Seamus Finnigan: you should compare it to books of same word count
2/7/18, 10:54 AM - Seamus Finnigan: like when we hit Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone
2/7/18, 10:54 AM - Seamus Finnigan: vs War and peace
2/7/18, 10:54 AM - Penelope Clearwater: Good idea!
2/7/18, 10:54 AM - Seamus Finnigan: but that would need live update i guess
2/7/18, 10:54 AM - Seamus Finnigan: is it easy to replace w a new data dump
2/7/18, 10:55 AM - Seamus Finnigan: if you re-download every couple of days
2/7/18, 10:55 AM - Minerva McGonagall: hahaha thats great ege
2/7/18, 10:55 AM - Seamus Finnigan: id like to see comparison of words-used

2/7/18, 10:57 AM - Penelope Clearwater: Def not doing word clouds I hate those
2/7/18, 10:58 AM - Penelope Clearwater: Yea it's easy to replace with a new data dump

2/7/18, 11:00 AM - Luna Lovegood: Like the biggest number of messages immediately following a pic post for a given amountoftime
2/7/18, 11:00 AM - Minerva McGonagall: or who says who elses name the most
2/7/18, 11:00 AM - Seamus Finnigan: will its you saying michaels name duh
2/7/18, 11:00 AM - Luna Lovegood: also some sort of location map to determine where we've all been sending messages from

2/7/18, 11:53 AM - Hermione Granger: Hahahaha
2/7/18, 11:54 AM - Hermione Granger: Many hands make light work ....
2/7/18, 11:54 AM - Minerva McGonagall: Should we start talking to publishers or wait till we get a little more...
2/7/18, 11:56 AM - Hermione Granger: I love how we already have sub stories, e.g. Starbros etc
2/7/18, 11:56 AM - Hermione Granger: Publishers will like that
2/7/18, 12:07 PM - Draco Malfoy: you should sort the names frmo high to low participation right now the sorting is weird
2/7/18, 12:14 PM - Hermione Granger: It's not a participation competition !
2/7/18, 12:15 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Right
2/7/18, 12:19 PM - Minerva McGonagall: It‚Äôs not a competition... but miles is winning
2/7/18, 12:21 PM - Hermione Granger: Hahaha
2/7/18, 12:33 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Lol
2/7/18, 12:47 PM - Severus Snape: I'm shocked by this data. Fundamentally don't understand how miles is at almost 2.5x my message count
2/7/18, 12:48 PM - Hermione Granger: Does it go by amount of words or messages sent ?
2/7/18, 1:02 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Messages sent
2/7/18, 1:03 PM - Penelope Clearwater: So I'm thinking of a more xomplex way to define participation. Something That factors in messages sent and length of messages
2/7/18, 1:03 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Mike I think it's cuz I tend to respond to messages with a lol or nice
2/7/18, 1:03 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Or tru
2/7/18, 1:04 PM - Penelope Clearwater: And I write many short messages while you write longer ones
2/7/18, 1:05 PM - Severus Snape: Then that should be borne out in word count ü§î
2/7/18, 1:06 PM - Penelope Clearwater: What
2/7/18, 1:06 PM - Severus Snape: If ur messages are shorter than mine then our word counts should be closer than our message counts
2/7/18, 1:12 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Ok. So you're saying I should just count the words?
2/7/18, 1:14 PM - Severus Snape: I think word count and words/message would be interesting to see
2/7/18, 1:23 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Cool

2/7/18, 5:44 PM - Draco Malfoy: James, as usual is right, you can‚Äôt quantify with metrics when someone just nails the right emoji.
