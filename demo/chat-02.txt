9/2/17, 11:40 AM - Miles Gilbert: Board game idea: 
It's called A Perfect World
It's a game you play with others against the game. 
Object is to create the perfect society in 5(?) rounds. 
At the beginning of the game, all players choose from a deck of cards what they think the perfect society looks like. Then all players work together to create a society that in some way supports all player chosen cards. Players use a combination of resources, buildings, and negotionation to achieve perfection.
9/2/17, 11:41 AM - DL Tashjian: Pretty cool
9/2/17, 11:41 AM - Michael Lindsay: is this a sidequest
9/2/17, 11:41 AM - DL Tashjian: Are they're any sort of dystopian undercurrents
9/2/17, 11:41 AM - Michael Lindsay: i think the difficulty would be the dystopian undercurrent
9/2/17, 11:41 AM - DL Tashjian: Like one person draws a card that says you have to sacrifice something every round to achieve a perfect society
9/2/17, 11:42 AM - Michael Lindsay: lol
9/2/17, 11:56 AM - William Welles: holy shit miles, besdies the game sounding great you totally just proved your spot on the new bro alignment chart i thought of yesterday so perfectly
9/2/17, 11:56 AM - William Welles: but its using another system not D&D
9/2/17, 11:56 AM - DL Tashjian: Hahaha
9/2/17, 11:57 AM - Michael Lindsay: interest piqued
9/2/17, 11:57 AM - William Welles: I don't have photoshop and I cna't talk about it till I have visual!
9/2/17, 11:57 AM - Miles Gilbert: Oh yea
9/2/17, 11:57 AM - William Welles: but ege got the spoiler when I tried to get his high brain to whip something up
9/2/17, 11:58 AM - Miles Gilbert: Maybe one person to screw it up and get all the opposites
9/2/17, 11:58 AM - Miles Gilbert: Ok so you have to build a deck of cards that match the perfect world deck.
9/2/17, 11:58 AM - William Welles: have you played one of those games miles where eeryone is a on a team but theres a secret person working against the team and no one knows who they are?
9/2/17, 11:59 AM - William Welles: shadows over camelot etc.
9/2/17, 11:59 AM - Michael Lindsay: ahhh. like a deckbuilding coop game
9/2/17, 11:59 AM - Miles Gilbert: Yeah I think so
9/2/17, 11:59 AM - William Welles: like one person actually wants to rule everyone but pretending to be doing the best for the group
9/2/17, 11:59 AM - Miles Gilbert: I feel like I have
9/2/17, 11:59 AM - Michael Lindsay: i don't like the shadows over camelot idea for this game bc it seems like the game is about how hard building utopia is
9/2/17, 12:00 PM - William Welles: yeah thats true
9/2/17, 12:00 PM - William Welles: it might override the subtlety
9/2/17, 12:00 PM - Michael Lindsay: this is not dissimilar from The Grizzled
9/2/17, 12:00 PM - William Welles: the concept that utopia is impossible b/c everyone has different ideas about what it means is a super interesting thesis for a game
9/2/17, 12:01 PM - Michael Lindsay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOWXky7cYU or something, dunno what a good video is
9/2/17, 12:02 PM - Michael Lindsay: you're all trying to survive world war one together, but it is increasingly difficult to deal with the deck even though you're all aligned
9/2/17, 12:04 PM - William Welles: theres also something to the idea that utopia is fragile that its much easier to destroy than to build/preserve
9/3/17, 10:22 AM - Miles Gilbert: <Media omitted>
9/3/17, 10:36 AM - DL Tashjian: Dang are they filming

9/3/17, 11:43 AM - DL Tashjian: Me neither
9/12/17, 8:52 AM - William Welles: having a weird thing with the switch where it makes me want to play games I've never considered playing before... like saw NBA2k18 is coming out for it and I was like.... yeah I'd be down for that on switch... I think playing subways, trains, bed, is the gamechanger?
9/12/17, 9:44 AM - Miles Gilbert: Oh yeah. I'm so hungry for handhelds that I'd play anything
9/12/17, 9:44 AM - Miles Gilbert: I almost downloaded Sonic. Still might
9/12/17, 9:45 AM - William Welles: I played through all of it already 😂
9/12/17, 9:55 AM - DL Tashjian: Through Sonic?
9/12/17, 9:55 AM - DL Tashjian: I just got the expansion pack for the hurricane
9/12/17, 9:55 AM - DL Tashjian: I haven't really gotten anything except the travel medallion
9/12/17, 9:56 AM - DL Tashjian: But it's worth it because of that and also there is a feature added to the map that traces your footsteps and shows you where you haven't been
9/12/17, 10:00 AM - William Welles: Does that work backwards? Like does it only start working when you get it or will it show you everywhere you've been since you started playing?
9/12/17, 10:01 AM - DL Tashjian: Everywhere since you've started
9/12/17, 10:01 AM - William Welles: Nice
9/12/17, 10:02 AM - Miles Gilbert: Yeah. It's helped me find a lot of new shrines
9/12/17, 10:02 AM - William Welles: damn

9/12/17, 10:04 AM - William Welles: theres just like so much mining busywork and shit that its a great late night subway home game when you're too zonked to read or play zelda
9/12/17, 10:06 AM - Miles Gilbert: Ugh. I been so close to downloading Minecraft again. I heard the music the other day in a video and got chills
9/12/17, 10:07 AM - William Welles: I was off it for almost 2 years

9/12/17, 10:07 AM - William Welles: was bummed about starting a new world after so much work but now I'm not minding as much
9/12/17, 10:08 AM - DL Tashjian: Havent done Eventide island... Landed on it and then left cuz I didn't wanna do it yet.
9/12/17, 10:29 AM - Miles Gilbert: It's really fun. Did it on a plane rude this weekend. Was def too high level for it. But I played it like I was weaker.
9/12/17, 10:31 AM - William Welles: I stumbled on it really early on and couldn't beat the boss for the life of me. Then came back way later and finished it.
9/12/17, 10:32 AM - DL Tashjian: Dang ok maybe I'm too powerful
9/12/17, 10:33 AM - DL Tashjian: Apparently trial of the sword is really tough
9/12/17, 10:33 AM - DL Tashjian: Dunno if I wanna try it
9/12/17, 10:34 AM - William Welles: Generally i found if you like exploring and shrinking you get OP for most set challenges by the time you fight big G def fun to try everything on the early side even if you can't beat it
9/12/17, 10:38 AM - DL Tashjian: Yeah
9/12/17, 10:38 AM - DL Tashjian: I'm having so much fun exploring and like logging stuff now
9/12/17, 11:03 AM - Miles Gilbert: I finally found the monster shop. Bought all the masks 😈

9/12/17, 11:08 AM - Miles Gilbert: Savage
9/12/17, 11:08 AM - DL Tashjian: Dude the masks are the best
9/12/17, 11:08 AM - William Welles: It was when I got hooked on upgrading my gear
9/12/17, 11:09 AM - DL Tashjian: I've marked like 10 Lynels on my map... Always on the hunt
9/12/17, 11:09 AM - William Welles: Which was fun but ultimately mad the game way too easy
9/12/17, 11:09 AM - William Welles: Even the strongest lynol like only takes away a heart when you're buffed
9/12/17, 11:09 AM - Michael Lindsay: <Media omitted>
9/12/17, 11:09 AM - DL Tashjian: Upgrading gear is so fun tho cuz you really gotta trek around
9/12/17, 11:09 AM - DL Tashjian: Hahaha
9/12/17, 11:10 AM - DL Tashjian: I'm trying to not fast travel rn and just roam. Make fires if it gets too late. Watch for shooting stars n stuff. And find shrines
9/12/17, 11:10 AM - DL Tashjian: / generally not playing the shrines unless they tests of strength
9/12/17, 11:10 AM - DL Tashjian: Saving the puzzle for l8r
9/12/17, 11:10 AM - Miles Gilbert: Sounds like a perfect life tbh
9/12/17, 11:11 AM - Miles Gilbert: I'm dumb. What do the shooting stars mean
9/12/17, 11:11 AM - William Welles: They mean a beautiful cosmic experience that you might see if you weren't glued to your sheika slate!
9/12/17, 11:11 AM - Miles Gilbert: Lol
9/12/17, 11:11 AM - DL Tashjian: They fall and you catch em

9/12/17, 11:14 AM - DL Tashjian: You make food with dragon horns yet? Big time.boost
9/12/17, 11:14 AM - William Welles: I was having horrible luck where the blood moon would pop mid dragon fight like 6 times in a row. Only thing in the game that really frustrated me
9/12/17, 11:14 AM - DL Tashjian: Nooooo
9/12/17, 11:15 AM - DL Tashjian: Wish you could have better tracking for blood moon
9/12/17, 11:15 AM - William Welles: It was like over and over and it would reset literally mid battle
9/12/17, 11:15 AM - William Welles: Or like just don't reset the dragons w BM
9/12/17, 11:18 AM - DL Tashjian: Yeah
9/12/17, 11:18 AM - DL Tashjian: But you can only get one dragon piece per day I think
9/12/17, 11:19 AM - DL Tashjian: So you gotta harvest it then camp and it'll be on the same path
9/12/17, 11:19 AM - DL Tashjian: So you gotta find out where they are at a good time
9/12/17, 11:19 AM - DL Tashjian: I got my Markers on the map for it

9/12/17, 12:09 PM - DL Tashjian: Maybe just cuz I'm sort of in it
9/12/17, 12:10 PM - William Welles: Hahaha it def was like a few weeks for me. I had a great time. I'd do all the major fun quests before you go too deep bc they'll be a cake walk after
9/12/17, 12:12 PM - DL Tashjian: Dang. Well can you name a few? I feel like I did all the majors

9/12/17, 4:56 PM - DL Tashjian: I'd def wanna run a shroom stand

9/13/17, 7:57 AM - Miles Gilbert: Oh?? 👀
9/13/17, 12:08 PM - Miles Gilbert: Are there any other games u guys know about that have the concept of debt ?
9/13/17, 12:08 PM - Miles Gilbert: Besides animal crossing of course
9/13/17, 12:09 PM - William Welles: cities skylines you can go into debt and take out loans
9/13/17, 12:09 PM - Michael Lindsay: offworld mining company
9/13/17, 12:09 PM - William Welles: crusader kings 2, Europa Universalis 4 both have loans
9/13/17, 12:09 PM - William Welles: oh yeah and OFfworld mining company its like the main mechanic of the game
9/13/17, 12:10 PM - Miles Gilbert: oh right.. i forgot about the concept of loans
9/13/17, 12:10 PM - Michael Lindsay: prob hot dog stand has loans
9/13/17, 12:10 PM - Miles Gilbert: i guess i was thinking more along the lines of animal crossing.. like an individual player trying to build their life rather than a city building game

10/3/17, 6:49 PM - William Welles: i'm so nervous about it though
10/3/17, 6:50 PM - William Welles: also... even though it fits a series really well... I thought it would be great as a film - but we'll see i'll def watch
10/3/17, 6:50 PM - Michael Lindsay: What is it some marvel thing for lames

10/3/17, 6:51 PM - DL Tashjian: Hahaha
10/3/17, 6:55 PM - William Welles: its also not a good sign that its a hulu show b/c they're incapable of making TV
10/3/17, 6:56 PM - DL Tashjian: Didn't handmaiden win a bunch of stuff
10/3/17, 6:56 PM - DL Tashjian: (didn't watch it)
10/3/17, 6:56 PM - Michael Lindsay: Ew
10/3/17, 6:56 PM - William Welles: yeah but I think that might be partly due to the politics of the show and not the show... full disclosure I only watched the pilot but I didn't think it was super well done... maybe it got better though?
10/3/17, 6:57 PM - William Welles: I liked the book though :/
10/3/17, 6:57 PM - William Welles: what do we think of the casting:

10/3/17, 6:58 PM - Michael Lindsay: That casting is dope
10/3/17, 6:59 PM - Michael Lindsay: Tale pilot was square root of equilibrium level
10/3/17, 6:59 PM - William Welles: yeah I think its pretty solid
10/3/17, 6:59 PM - William Welles: Chase is gunna be Mike's fav character obvi
10/3/17, 7:21 PM - Miles Gilbert: I really liked how handmaiden was shot. And how it went back and forth between the two time periods. Agreed the book was better in that it was able to really depict the depression and isolation of the main character. Something tv can rarely do. It had to be a feminist power tale.
10/3/17, 7:22 PM - Miles Gilbert: Which is probs a big reason why it won so many awards given the politics
10/3/17, 7:22 PM - Miles Gilbert: What's this other show y'all are gabbin about
10/3/17, 7:22 PM - William Welles: Runaways! Based on the hit young adult comic Runaways!!

10/21/17, 8:49 PM - Michael Lindsay: Record a vid!
10/21/17, 8:49 PM - Michael Lindsay: But either way I can't watch lol. At a bar
10/21/17, 8:50 PM - Miles Gilbert: :-=_=
10/21/17, 8:50 PM - Michael Lindsay: Wat
10/21/17, 8:51 PM - Michael Lindsay: Is that a gun
10/21/17, 9:05 PM - Miles Gilbert: I wonder what actor has performed the most scenes in a robe
10/21/17, 9:06 PM - Michael Lindsay: Ewan McGregor
10/21/17, 9:06 PM - William Welles: Jimmy Stewart?
10/21/17, 9:06 PM - Michael Lindsay: James gabdplfini if we count TV
10/21/17, 9:07 PM - William Welles: Yeah for sure
10/21/17, 9:08 PM - Michael Lindsay: High Hefner if we count Playboy After Dark back in the day
10/22/17, 8:20 AM - Miles Gilbert: Lol
10/23/17, 9:01 AM - Michael Lindsay: Insane weekend in gaming. The website I've been going to daily since 2006 vanished from the Earth. The creator and owner of NeoGAF was accused of sexual assault on FB and admins mass resigned and the site went dark within hours. That was Saturday. Still no word from anyone associated with the site
10/23/17, 9:03 AM - Michael Lindsay: It would be a minor curiosity for a top 1000 website to vanish, but in this case what sucks is they were huge warriors against gamergate. Look at Twitter to see all the big names in gamergate getting giddy and throwing around sjw and stuff. Kind of a fall of Gondor situation
10/23/17, 9:28 AM - Miles Gilbert: Whoa
10/23/17, 9:46 AM - DL Tashjian: What is gamergate
10/23/17, 9:52 AM - Michael Lindsay: Gamergate controversy - Wikipedia
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy
10/23/17, 9:52 AM - Miles Gilbert: What is Gondor
10/23/17, 9:53 AM - DL Tashjian: I know what that is
10/23/17, 9:53 AM - DL Tashjian: Lotr duh
10/23/17, 9:53 AM - Michael Lindsay: Misogyny movement for gaming fans that is one of the first organizing communities for the white supremacy people pre-trump
10/23/17, 9:55 AM - Miles Gilbert: lol.. u all know i hate lotr
10/23/17, 9:57 AM - Miles Gilbert: well.. i'll be looking out for the official statement from neogaf. seems like a shame for the whole site to collapse.
10/23/17, 9:58 AM - Michael Lindsay: I wouldn't bother. The site is gone
10/23/17, 9:59 AM - Michael Lindsay: Would take a miracle+the owner divesting for it to return
10/23/17, 9:59 AM - Miles Gilbert: dang for real?
10/23/17, 9:59 AM - Michael Lindsay: Yeah I mean would you keep using a site that went down like this?
10/23/17, 10:00 AM - Michael Lindsay: People will migrate. This is basically what happened to digg
10/23/17, 10:00 AM - Miles Gilbert: what do u mean? went down like what?
10/23/17, 10:00 AM - Miles Gilbert: because the owner was accused of sexual harrasment? were the admins involved?
10/23/17, 10:01 AM - DL Tashjian: So gamergate isn't an actual place it's a movement based around a #?
10/23/17, 10:02 AM - DL Tashjian: That's crazy man
10/23/17, 10:03 AM - Michael Lindsay: That collapsed bc the (shitty, prideful) owner couldn't get his mods/admins to stick around bc he was a sexual assaulter. Now u either go back to a site of a sexual assaulter or somehow he's gone and all the great admins that left come back and community members
10/23/17, 10:03 AM - Michael Lindsay: Right DL
10/23/17, 10:03 AM - DL Tashjian: Wild wild
10/23/17, 10:04 AM - Michael Lindsay: Plus 72 hours silence is a lifetime in Internet
10/23/17, 10:05 AM - Miles Gilbert: I guess im having trouble understanding why the second scenario is impossible or unlikely
10/23/17, 10:06 AM - Miles Gilbert: i dont really understand neogaf
10/23/17, 10:06 AM - Michael Lindsay: The Exodus was admin-led and fierce. Seems doubtful
10/23/17, 10:06 AM - DL Tashjian: I would think someone would just start a new site?
10/23/17, 10:06 AM - Michael Lindsay: It's just a forum
10/23/17, 10:06 AM - DL Tashjian: New name new co
10/23/17, 10:06 AM - Michael Lindsay: Right DL. We'll see if it's possible
10/23/17, 10:06 AM - Miles Gilbert: theres geonaf.com
10/23/17, 10:07 AM - DL Tashjian: Lol
10/23/17, 10:07 AM - DL Tashjian: Is game faqs not cool nemore?
10/23/17, 10:07 AM - Michael Lindsay: And a few others. Recapturing what was a site with tens of millions of visitors will not be simple
10/23/17, 10:07 AM - DL Tashjian: Or reddit
10/23/17, 10:07 AM - Michael Lindsay: No
10/23/17, 10:07 AM - DL Tashjian: Love me some reddit

10/23/17, 10:08 AM - Miles Gilbert: gamefaqs for liiiiife
10/23/17, 10:08 AM - Michael Lindsay: They have their uses but not as a discussion forum
10/23/17, 10:08 AM - DL Tashjian: What about reddit
10/23/17, 10:11 AM - Miles Gilbert: discord
10/23/17, 10:11 AM - Michael Lindsay: Full of racists/misogynists in my experience
10/23/17, 10:11 AM - Miles Gilbert: what about discord... u on that mike?
10/23/17, 10:11 AM - Michael Lindsay: I'm not

10/23/17, 10:12 AM - Michael Lindsay: Yeah I don't know much about it. I thought I used it for voice chat for a game so...not sure how it works
10/23/17, 10:12 AM - Michael Lindsay: I might try Something Awful for myself

10/25/17, 8:40 AM - Miles Gilbert: Fyi the 😤 emoji is officially called "triumph" even tho most use it as a negative emoji like anger
10/25/17, 8:41 AM - Miles Gilbert: Or maybe it's named after the insult comic dog
10/25/17, 9:16 AM - William Welles: Like

10/26/17, 9:55 AM - William Welles: compared to what?
10/26/17, 9:56 AM - William Welles: pretty hard I guess its just plastic and glass
10/26/17, 9:56 AM - William Welles: but not as hard as stone?
10/26/17, 10:00 AM - Miles Gilbert: diamonds > stone > TVs

10/27/17, 10:26 PM - DL Tashjian: Not until I've watched stranger things
10/29/17, 3:43 PM - Adam Polonski: Holy shit New Donk City.
10/29/17, 3:44 PM - Adam Polonski: Mario boys, are you taking your time in each world or progressing with plans to return later?
10/29/17, 3:44 PM - Michael Lindsay: There's so much to say 😭
10/29/17, 3:44 PM - Michael Lindsay: Half and half depending on mood and catching up
10/29/17, 3:44 PM - Michael Lindsay: <Media omitted>
10/29/17, 4:00 PM - William Welles: Yeah a mix.  I let the moment take me
10/29/17, 4:00 PM - William Welles: Apple send your friend code and DL
10/29/17, 4:00 PM - Michael Lindsay: <Media omitted>
10/29/17, 5:52 PM - DL Tashjian: Reading some reviews that say Mario is not as fun when portable... That it's better to play with the joy con dettached... Any truth to this?
10/29/17, 6:25 PM - Michael Lindsay: Slightly true
10/31/17, 8:40 AM - DL Tashjian: guys i can't decide whether or not to spend the money on mario or keep looking for shines and koroks?
10/31/17, 8:46 AM - Adam Polonski: Mario for sure
10/31/17, 8:58 AM - Miles Gilbert: Guys I'm skipping Mario. That's why I've been so mum about it. But please keep sharing your fun and progress in the game. I enjoy it.
10/31/17, 8:59 AM - William Welles: 😱😱😱
10/31/17, 9:00 AM - DL Tashjian: good to hear... I've been kind of feeling the same way. but i agree. keep talking about it guys cuz it'll probably make me wanna start at some point
10/31/17, 9:00 AM - Adam Polonski: Reading that was like an icepick in the head - why Miles why!
10/31/17, 9:00 AM - DL Tashjian: seeing william and michael play zelda is what made me get a switch
10/31/17, 9:02 AM - Miles Gilbert: Buncha reasons
1. Money and time is tight with the new house 
2. I have a giant backlog of games still in the shrink 😬
3. Most importantly tho, I've never really enjoyed a Mario game. There I said it
10/31/17, 9:03 AM - William Welles: I won’t argue - but will just point out... you never enjoyed a Zelda game till the new one either
10/31/17, 9:04 AM - DL Tashjian: i haven't thoroughly enjoyed a mario game (kart franchise excluded) since mario 64
10/31/17, 9:04 AM - DL Tashjian: The wii one involved too much twitching of the wrist
10/31/17, 9:05 AM - Miles Gilbert: I thought about that will. But I never played a Zelda game and loved botw. But I tried to played many Mario games over the past years and never liked them. That's the difference
10/31/17, 9:05 AM - William Welles: fair enough
10/31/17, 9:06 AM - Miles Gilbert: I want to go back and play the Zelda hits
10/31/17, 9:06 AM - Adam Polonski: Yea I guess that's fair. This is like Mario 64 on steroids with a touch of Galaxy so if you didn't like those there you go
10/31/17, 9:07 AM - William Welles: but also I became a mario man hole cover so...
10/31/17, 9:07 AM - William Welles: but yeah being judicious about games is needed in this day and age
10/31/17, 9:07 AM - Miles Gilbert: Yea m64 gives me a panic attack
10/31/17, 9:07 AM - William Welles: too many good games to ever play
10/31/17, 9:07 AM - Miles Gilbert: So many
10/31/17, 9:07 AM - Miles Gilbert: It's been fun watching streams of Odyssey
10/31/17, 9:08 AM - William Welles: I'm basically at.... only play switch games unless its a strategy game on computer...
10/31/17, 9:08 AM - William Welles: but I'll need to narrow beyond that pretty soon
10/31/17, 9:10 AM - Adam Polonski: Yea all I do is play stardew, switch games, and paradox strat games and even that is both too much and not enough at the same time
10/31/17, 9:13 AM - Miles Gilbert: What about Doom on switch. Y'all getting it or nah
10/31/17, 9:14 AM - William Welles: not for now... got too much mario to chew through
10/31/17, 9:14 AM - William Welles: that sounds like something fun to pop like if I have a big plane trip coming up
10/31/17, 9:15 AM - Miles Gilbert: Yea. I wonder if it has local multi. That would be dope around Thanksgiving
10/31/17, 9:15 AM - William Welles: oh ye
10/31/17, 1:23 PM - Michael Lindsay: No one mentioned the dogs to miles. Wth
10/31/17, 2:06 PM - William Welles: <Media omitted>
10/31/17, 2:06 PM - William Welles: this doge?
10/31/17, 2:22 PM - Miles Gilbert: Shibe
10/31/17, 2:23 PM - Miles Gilbert: I guess I just don't like platformers
10/31/17, 2:23 PM - Miles Gilbert: What do u all think about that
10/31/17, 2:23 PM - Michael Lindsay: It's not a platformer. It's a your life sim. The doggy follows you around each level and plays fetch with you
10/31/17, 2:24 PM - Miles Gilbert: Looks like a platformer tho
10/31/17, 2:24 PM - Miles Gilbert: Be real with me
10/31/17, 2:24 PM - William Welles: Yeah it’s a platformer
10/31/17, 2:24 PM - William Welles: Can’t lie to a bro
10/31/17, 2:24 PM - Miles Gilbert: Thanx
10/31/17, 2:25 PM - Michael Lindsay: Excuse me where's the lie
10/31/17, 2:25 PM - William Welles: You’re excused
10/31/17, 2:29 PM - Miles Gilbert: I also can't think of other platformers. Like what is one that I might have played
10/31/17, 2:29 PM - William Welles: It’s def not as much of a genre as it used to be
10/31/17, 2:29 PM - William Welles: Tomb raider 1 ?
10/31/17, 2:29 PM - Miles Gilbert: Lol yea
10/31/17, 2:29 PM - William Welles: Any sonic game kinda
10/31/17, 2:30 PM - Miles Gilbert: Crash bandicoot
10/31/17, 2:30 PM - William Welles: Jack and dexter
10/31/17, 2:30 PM - William Welles: Beyond good and evil ?
10/31/17, 2:30 PM - Miles Gilbert: Yea
10/31/17, 2:30 PM - William Welles: Space station Silicon Valley?
10/31/17, 2:31 PM - William Welles: Picboys?
10/31/17, 2:32 PM - Miles Gilbert: Lol I googled pic boys and it just gave me pics of boys
10/31/17, 2:32 PM - William Welles: oh its the prequel to picmen
10/31/17, 2:32 PM - William Welles: all those pics had to grow up at some point
10/31/17, 2:35 PM - Miles Gilbert: oooooo
10/31/17, 2:36 PM - Michael Lindsay: What Nintendo was doing I think is truly remarkable regardless of the industry we're talking about. Inasmuch as a Zelda is an adventure game if you would ever played adventure games from this year dating back to 1990, Mario Odyssey is a platformer. Instead of continuing the genre in the ways that you're expecting and familiar with Nintendo has taken the time energy and passion to refine and enhance the aspects that bring joy from the genre itself while removing the things you didn't know you didn't want so that when they're gone you don't even remember that they're not there. Odyssey is a joyful and surprising experience tuned with a Mozart level finesse to engage you elate you and improve you. There were a hundred things in Zelda that you could have changed 10 microns to make it vastly worse experience, but they were all exactly at 100. Mario is made by different people, but the Same Spirit Infuses it
10/31/17, 2:39 PM - Miles Gilbert: maybe i'll play it when I come back east to hang with u guys.. i am interested
10/31/17, 2:39 PM - Miles Gilbert: that all makes sense mike.. thanks for the thoughtful response
10/31/17, 2:42 PM - William Welles: zeldas cool though cuz its like swords like crazy bow shit like snick snack stab mario is like bouncey bouncey giggle giggle where's that hidden little pickle
10/31/17, 2:42 PM - William Welles: awaiting a thank you to me for my thoughtful response...
10/31/17, 2:45 PM - Michael Lindsay: 😂😂😂
10/31/17, 2:45 PM - Miles Gilbert: <Media omitted>
10/31/17, 2:45 PM - Miles Gilbert: yea i'm super into bow shit
10/31/17, 4:41 PM - Miles Gilbert: <Media omitted>
10/31/17, 4:41 PM - Miles Gilbert: pretty gr8
10/31/17, 4:42 PM - Michael Lindsay: 😍
10/31/17, 4:44 PM - Miles Gilbert: how does princess peach factor into the game
10/31/17, 4:44 PM - Miles Gilbert: just kidnapped again?
10/31/17, 4:45 PM - Michael Lindsay: No spoilers
10/31/17, 4:45 PM - DL Tashjian: Lol
10/31/17, 4:46 PM - DL Tashjian: Wait Miles if you're such a non Mario guy home come you were always peach in smash?
10/31/17, 4:46 PM - DL Tashjian: Are you a huge Mario 2 fan?!!!!
10/31/17, 4:46 PM - Michael Lindsay: ☝
10/31/17, 4:46 PM - Miles Gilbert: its just my best char
10/31/17, 4:47 PM - Miles Gilbert: as far as i'm concerned, peach is a Smash character... not a mario character
10/31/17, 4:47 PM - DL Tashjian: But did you try a bunch or did you just gravitate to her?
10/31/17, 4:47 PM - DL Tashjian: Hahahaha
10/31/17, 4:47 PM - Miles Gilbert: i see a strong, independent woman.... the mario series sees her as an object
10/31/17, 4:47 PM - William Welles: not in mario + rabbids though lol
10/31/17, 4:48 PM - Miles Gilbert: i tried a bunch... but it was during a time in my life (most of my life tbh) when i always played as a woman any chance i could get
10/31/17, 4:48 PM - William Welles: she's the strongest char and has a shotgun that lights people on fire
10/31/17, 4:48 PM - Miles Gilbert: is it really her or is it a rabbid peach
10/31/17, 4:48 PM - William Welles: its her
10/31/17, 4:48 PM - William Welles: theres both
10/31/17, 4:48 PM - Miles Gilbert: i know nothing about that game
10/31/17, 4:48 PM - William Welles: she's never captured and just shows up w a shotty to save the day
10/31/17, 4:48 PM - William Welles: I like it :D
10/31/17, 4:48 PM - Miles Gilbert: maybe i'll get into that.. i like the xcom approach
10/31/17, 4:48 PM - DL Tashjian: Lol. Mario and Bowser def put Peach on the pedestal imo. I mean... I don't really know much about her compared to say...
 Princess Zelda
10/31/17, 4:49 PM - William Welles: I'm all about Pauline - working woman, mayor of New Donk City, singer
10/31/17, 4:49 PM - DL Tashjian: Hahahaha
10/31/17, 4:49 PM - DL Tashjian: Ugh this makes me wanna play Odyssey now... It's happening
10/31/17, 4:50 PM - William Welles: I def rolled my eyes at peach's roll in odyssey b/c I thought that their games had moved past it numerous times already...
10/31/17, 4:50 PM - William Welles: like they were already subverting her being a captive in mario RPG in like 1996
10/31/17, 4:51 PM - Michael Lindsay: Will. Spoilers
10/31/17, 4:51 PM - William Welles: they said they aren't playing and want us to talk about it... also she gets kidnapped in the opening movie...
10/31/17, 4:52 PM - Miles Gilbert: lol.. we all know she gets kidnapped hahaha
10/31/17, 4:53 PM - Michael Lindsay: I don't want to get into a discussion about whether or not I agree with Will's interp. I'm not assuming these boys won't rent it
10/31/17, 4:54 PM - DL Tashjian: Lol I'm pretty sure she gets kidnapped in the trailer
10/31/17, 4:54 PM - William Welles: I mean... regardless she gets kidnapped in first scene and is kidnapped until the last scene... I'm just saying I was honestly surprised and disappointed they were still playing that 95% straight faced....when as I said they were already trying to subvert it 2 decades ago
10/31/17, 4:55 PM - Adam Polonski: Whoa ending spoilers bucko
10/31/17, 4:55 PM - Michael Lindsay: ☝ that's just straight up spoilers. Uncool
10/31/17, 4:55 PM - Adam Polonski: Agree
10/31/17, 4:55 PM - Adam Polonski: I hear your point though, this one is a step back even more so because of Bowser's explicit motivation
10/31/17, 4:55 PM - Miles Gilbert: lol.. better add it to my gamefly list
10/31/17, 4:55 PM - William Welles: 🙄 Aeris dies
10/31/17, 4:56 PM - Miles Gilbert: lol
10/31/17, 4:56 PM - Michael Lindsay: Finish the game apol
10/31/17, 4:56 PM - DL Tashjian: I prefer daisy
10/31/17, 4:56 PM - Miles Gilbert: daisy can get it
10/31/17, 4:56 PM - William Welles: I wanna see more Pauline myself - I'm liking her more than daisy rn
10/31/17, 4:56 PM - Adam Polonski: I prefer Pauline and can't wait to  see what the internet does with her and Mario
10/31/17, 4:57 PM - DL Tashjian: Yeah but you need to be weary of politicians
10/31/17, 4:57 PM - Miles Gilbert: ooooo
10/31/17, 4:57 PM - William Welles: especially ones with golden statues of themselves in the city souvenir shops...
10/31/17, 4:58 PM - DL Tashjian: Sounds like a donkey kong villain
10/31/17, 4:58 PM - Adam Polonski: Yeà it may be a mayoralty but there's a reason it's still called the metro kingdom
10/31/17, 4:58 PM - Michael Lindsay: #ironic
10/31/17, 4:58 PM - Adam Polonski: Cult of personality there a bit
10/31/17, 4:58 PM - DL Tashjian: Maybe cuz she's the mayor of new donk
10/31/17, 4:59 PM - Miles Gilbert: wow.. just reading up on pauline's history... cool that they made her the mayor
10/31/17, 4:59 PM - DL Tashjian: Will they do a donkey conga for switch?
10/31/17, 5:00 PM - Miles Gilbert: has there ever been a character of color in a mario game? don't say donkey kong 😰
10/31/17, 5:01 PM - Michael Lindsay: Gonna go with no
10/31/17, 5:01 PM - William Welles: New Donk has townspeople of many races... but they aren't main chars...
10/31/17, 5:02 PM - Adam Polonski: I think there have been some toads of color before but I can't swear to it
10/31/17, 5:02 PM - Miles Gilbert: toad of color
10/31/17, 5:02 PM - Miles Gilbert: lol
10/31/17, 5:02 PM - Michael Lindsay: The relevant answer is no 😂
10/31/17, 5:02 PM - Miles Gilbert: hard to google, but i found this
10/31/17, 5:02 PM - Miles Gilbert: After 30 years there are still zero Mario characters of color, a problem that Mario Kart 8 highlights by lining up all the characters on a single screen. When it comes to human characters, Mario Kart 8 is overwhelmingly white. Of the 29 drivers, 14 are human (including Toad and Toadette), and every single one of them is white. While it’d be atypical of Nintendo to introduce new characters into a Mario Kart game, it’s also where the deficit is the most obvious, and during play I found myself disappointed that Nintendo’s stable of characters so painfully fails to reflect the diversity of its audience.
10/31/17, 5:02 PM - Miles Gilbert: odd that they, too, count toads as humans lol
10/31/17, 5:03 PM - Michael Lindsay: Lol specifically
10/31/17, 5:03 PM - DL Tashjian: Lol miles I googled it too
10/31/17, 5:03 PM - Michael Lindsay: Like, can they literally have children with Mario/peach
10/31/17, 5:03 PM - Adam Polonski: This is a game where the main character is an Italian plumber and the most basic enemy's name is an Italian slur
10/31/17, 5:03 PM - Michael Lindsay: 😂
10/31/17, 5:03 PM - Adam Polonski: They are losing bad in this department
10/31/17, 5:04 PM - William Welles: *he's not technically italian anymore
10/31/17, 5:04 PM - DL Tashjian: What since when?
10/31/17, 5:04 PM - William Welles: according to nintendo
10/31/17, 5:04 PM - Miles Gilbert: oh word?
10/31/17, 5:04 PM - DL Tashjian: That was my asking will
10/31/17, 5:05 PM - William Welles: yeah nintendo announced it a few years ago
10/31/17, 5:05 PM - Adam Polonski: Yea they retconned it pretty recently
10/31/17, 5:05 PM - Michael Lindsay: The biggest eyebrow raise is the game is lack of cultural sensitivity. The Mexican kingdom is appropriated fully and with not much respect
10/31/17, 5:05 PM - William Welles: so they couldnt be accused of being racist even though he's obviously a racist stereotype
10/31/17, 5:05 PM - Adam Polonski: I think it's still official that his full name is Mario Mario though, hence the Mario brothers
10/31/17, 5:05 PM - William Welles: Nintendos new franchises have POC though
10/31/17, 5:06 PM - William Welles: splatoon has key POC characters
10/31/17, 5:06 PM - William Welles: main characters
10/31/17, 5:06 PM - Adam Polonski: And miyamoto confirmed a while back that yes Mario Bros 3 is actually a play, dramatizing Mario 1
10/31/17, 5:06 PM - Miles Gilbert: yea.. the scenes in the mexican kingdom definitely rub me the w r o n g way
10/31/17, 5:06 PM - Miles Gilbert: yea splatoon is MAD diverse
10/31/17, 5:07 PM - Miles Gilbert: but still not fun for me lol
10/31/17, 5:07 PM - Miles Gilbert: do you guys play?
10/31/17, 5:07 PM - Miles Gilbert: i have it and probably need friends who play
10/31/17, 5:07 PM - Miles Gilbert: :(
10/31/17, 5:07 PM - Michael Lindsay: There's no splitting hairs. They didn't get any of the memos written in the last 15+ years
10/31/17, 5:09 PM - William Welles: the weird part is they aren't like bad at creating cultures in games... in the same game they have like weird snow people who's entire existence revolves around bounce-based race courses
10/31/17, 5:10 PM - Miles Gilbert: what are you saying though? should they stick to creating entirely original cultures instead of appropriating existing ones?
10/31/17, 5:11 PM - William Welles: I mean... yes...
10/31/17, 5:11 PM - William Welles: maybe
10/31/17, 5:11 PM - Adam Polonski: Yea. I thought the Mexican kingdom was fine because it was so cartoony and wasn't exactly speedy Gonzalez but I still raised an eyebrow about it for sure. And it wasn't like, pinata world thankfully
10/31/17, 5:11 PM - Adam Polonski: Any other company did that and there would be an uproar though
10/31/17, 5:11 PM - Miles Gilbert: yea somehow nintendo gets a pass
10/31/17, 5:11 PM - Michael Lindsay: I thought it was basically speedy level
10/31/17, 5:12 PM - Miles Gilbert: i guess the cartoonishness of it contributes to them getting that pass
10/31/17, 5:13 PM - Michael Lindsay: Well we're talking about it
10/31/17, 5:13 PM - Michael Lindsay: I don't pass it
10/31/17, 5:13 PM - Miles Gilbert: word
10/31/17, 5:14 PM - Miles Gilbert: i guess i was talking about the lack of uproar.. per apps comment
10/31/17, 5:14 PM - Adam Polonski: Even the peach thing, there would be thinkpieces everywhere if like the new assassin's Creed was about saving the princess played straight
10/31/17, 5:14 PM - Miles Gilbert: waypoint radio mentioned the appropriation briefly... but not that much.... and they usually jump on that shit
10/31/17, 5:14 PM - Michael Lindsay: Finish the game ap
10/31/17, 5:15 PM - Adam Polonski: And I'm sure there is plenty of commentary on it but it's not rising to the top
10/31/17, 5:15 PM - Adam Polonski: Ha ok Mike
10/31/17, 5:15 PM - Miles Gilbert: oooooo.. can't wait to apps to finish the g a m e
10/31/17, 5:15 PM - Michael Lindsay: Before you get in on that
10/31/17, 5:15 PM - Miles Gilbert: mike did u finish
10/31/17, 5:15 PM - Michael Lindsay: There's a fuckton of post game
10/31/17, 5:16 PM - Michael Lindsay: More than the whole game
10/31/17, 5:16 PM - Adam Polonski: Oh man maybe the reveal is that peach and Bowser are in love and Mario is the spurned ex lover I'd be into that
10/31/17, 5:16 PM - Adam Polonski: Super Braid Odyssey
10/31/17, 5:16 PM - Adam Polonski: Mike that's exactly what I wanted to know thank goodness
10/31/17, 5:16 PM - Miles Gilbert: yea im so intot aht
10/31/17, 5:16 PM - Miles Gilbert: that
10/31/17, 5:17 PM - Michael Lindsay: 2-3x the game
10/31/17, 5:18 PM - William Welles: yeah the game is just picking up speed when the credits roll
10/31/17, 5:18 PM - William Welles: you can finish the game w like ...100-150 moons and there are 900 in the game
10/31/17, 5:19 PM - Miles Gilbert: Dang u both finished already
10/31/17, 5:19 PM - William Welles: oh ye
10/31/17, 5:19 PM - William Welles: mike was teasing me too hard about getting ahead
10/31/17, 5:19 PM - William Welles: so I had to even it out
10/31/17, 5:19 PM - Miles Gilbert: Typical
10/31/17, 5:21 PM - DL Tashjian: Do you get a goldeb poop emoji for finding all the moons?
10/31/17, 5:21 PM - Michael Lindsay: No spoilers. But actually. I'm not far
10/31/17, 5:22 PM - DL Tashjian: From 900?
10/31/17, 5:22 PM - DL Tashjian: Whoa
10/31/17, 6:55 PM - Miles Gilbert: <Media omitted>
10/31/17, 6:56 PM - Michael Lindsay: 😂😂😂
10/31/17, 6:59 PM - Miles Gilbert: <Media omitted>
10/31/17, 6:59 PM - Michael Lindsay: U bastard
10/31/17, 6:59 PM - Miles Gilbert: Lol that was for u Mike 😈
10/31/17, 6:59 PM - Michael Lindsay: Was gonna say that there's no way you'd choose the crazy capp suit
10/31/17, 6:59 PM - Miles Gilbert: Hahaha
10/31/17, 7:00 PM - Miles Gilbert: Ur right. I'd save up for the boxers
10/31/17, 7:00 PM - Miles Gilbert: Why are they 1000 dollars
10/31/17, 7:00 PM - Michael Lindsay: Supply and demand?
10/31/17, 7:01 PM - Adam Polonski: Well if you buy a thousand dollar pair of underpants you can wear it every day
10/31/17, 7:01 PM - Miles Gilbert: Tru
10/31/17, 7:02 PM - Miles Gilbert: Um this is the perfect game to watch while hihh
10/31/17, 7:02 PM - Michael Lindsay: Yep
10/31/17, 7:06 PM - Miles Gilbert: I wish no man's sky was more like Odyssey
10/31/17, 7:07 PM - Adam Polonski: I kinda want to play that shit again it looks way better now
10/31/17, 7:07 PM - Adam Polonski: And the concept is still cool as fuck
10/31/17, 7:07 PM - Miles Gilbert: Ya I heard someone talking about the improvements. Haven't dipped in
10/31/17, 7:07 PM - Miles Gilbert: Yea I'm still 1000% percent into the concept
10/31/17, 7:09 PM - Adam Polonski: Yea it just needed like.. some thing to actually do
10/31/17, 7:10 PM - Miles Gilbert: Booting up
10/31/17, 7:11 PM - Adam Polonski: Hell yeh
10/31/17, 7:11 PM - Miles Gilbert: <Media omitted>
10/31/17, 7:11 PM - Miles Gilbert: Not too bad tho I guess
10/31/17, 7:12 PM - Miles Gilbert: Modern gaming hurts
10/31/17, 7:14 PM - Adam Polonski: Hate that and it somehow happens every time
10/31/17, 7:15 PM - Miles Gilbert: Yeah. Back to da stream
10/31/17, 7:16 PM - DL Tashjian: Hahaha
10/31/17, 7:20 PM - Michael Lindsay: Picking out roms from gba, Genesis, etc to add to my Classic
10/31/17, 7:20 PM - Miles Gilbert: Ooo baby. What are u wearing
10/31/17, 7:21 PM - Michael Lindsay: Haha should I lie
10/31/17, 7:22 PM - Miles Gilbert: Lie to me. Don't make difference either way.
10/31/17, 7:22 PM - Miles Gilbert: Damnit I ruined the line
10/31/17, 7:23 PM - Michael Lindsay: What line?
10/31/17, 7:24 PM - Miles Gilbert: My line
10/31/17, 7:35 PM - Miles Gilbert: <Media omitted>
10/31/17, 7:35 PM - Michael Lindsay: Toasty
10/31/17, 8:03 PM - DL Tashjian: Who I wanna play that what is it
10/31/17, 10:55 PM - Adam Polonski: That's no man's sky and it's beautiful and luminous and also kind of boring
10/31/17, 10:55 PM - Adam Polonski: But wonderful in its way
10/31/17, 11:00 PM - Miles Gilbert: So far it's a little better. Still super chill but def some actual things happening besides just travelling. They also have ship classes now which was like duh. there's more npcs too
11/1/17, 9:57 AM - DL Tashjian: So the gist of the game is you travel around, learn languages and collect resources from an infinite source of randomly generated planets? All the while making your way to the center of the universe?
11/1/17, 9:57 AM - DL Tashjian: (I read the review)
11/1/17, 9:57 AM - DL Tashjian: How have I never played this before
11/1/17, 9:57 AM - DL Tashjian: Sounds like the most zen game of all time
11/1/17, 9:58 AM - DL Tashjian: If it was third person and you could change outfits and stuff based on climates and surroundings I'd appreciate it more.
11/1/17, 9:59 AM - DL Tashjian: I love making my character look dope
11/1/17, 10:00 AM - DL Tashjian: I want a space game that gives the feeling of this but is as open as no man's sky seemingly is
11/1/17, 10:00 AM - DL Tashjian: <Media omitted>
11/1/17, 10:02 AM - Miles Gilbert: You should give it a try man. It's super zen. Very solitary. A good wind down game.
11/1/17, 10:03 AM - Miles Gilbert: And they added a bunch of stuff since launch that should have been in there from the beginning.
11/1/17, 10:03 AM - William Welles: also try like abzu or whatever its called
11/1/17, 10:03 AM - William Welles: the swimming game on ps4
11/1/17, 10:08 AM - DL Tashjian: Abzu looks amazing
11/1/17, 10:08 AM - DL Tashjian: I don't have ps4
11/1/17, 10:08 AM - DL Tashjian: Maybetheyll do no man's sky on switch
11/1/17, 10:42 AM - Miles Gilbert: do u you guys think playstation or microsoft will come out with a switch-like device
11/1/17, 10:46 AM - William Welles: I don't think so - would be too hard for them to pivot and they value graphics too highly... but I bet they will consider it
11/1/17, 10:46 AM - William Welles: they also market themselves as like... home media hubs which would be harder to integrate into a switch like device
11/1/17, 10:48 AM - Miles Gilbert: true.. i like having the separate worlds of playstation and nintendo
11/1/17, 10:48 AM - William Welles: yeah its best that way
11/1/17, 10:48 AM - Miles Gilbert: different vibes
11/1/17, 11:29 AM - DL Tashjian: i agree with william
11/1/17, 11:29 AM - DL Tashjian: but i think we'll see more switch like devices that easily integrate with home hubs
11/1/17, 11:30 AM - DL Tashjian: so it's going to be hard to move forward considering the big boys don't want to all play nice together
11/1/17, 11:30 AM - DL Tashjian: it really annoys me how much big business holds back technological advance sometimes
11/1/17, 11:31 AM - DL Tashjian: as ambient tech becomes more prevalent, i think all gaming will become tablet based even if you're projecting or linking that tablet to a bigger screen eh?
11/1/17, 11:31 AM - DL Tashjian: ill shut up now
11/1/17, 12:03 PM - Miles Gilbert: nah bra.. keep them theories comin
11/1/17, 12:03 PM - Miles Gilbert: lets start a video game company
11/1/17, 12:03 PM - Michael Lindsay: Ok
11/1/17, 12:03 PM - Miles Gilbert: need to hire some women tho... anybody know any
11/1/17, 12:05 PM - Adam Polonski: Never met one but I hear good things
11/1/17, 12:06 PM - DL Tashjian: Dude you gotta watch halt and catch fire
11/1/17, 12:11 PM - William Welles: I wanna make viiiidddd ggaaaayyymmmeeesss
11/1/17, 12:14 PM - Adam Polonski: Ok let's make a medieval monastery life sim game aka stardew valley meets Agricola
11/1/17, 12:35 PM - DL Tashjian: I wanna be in on dis
11/1/17, 12:35 PM - William Welles: In
11/1/17, 12:36 PM - DL Tashjian: I want a zen game that I can play everyday to wind down that is all about exploration but the exploration is largely dependent on a kit building aspect
11/1/17, 12:36 PM - DL Tashjian: And I want it to be third person and not using some stupid fps engine
11/1/17, 12:36 PM - William Welles: I just want to be a monk
11/1/17, 12:36 PM - William Welles: Doing monk stuff
11/1/17, 12:37 PM - DL Tashjian: And you know there better be a jump button or else. None of that uncharted action button crap
11/1/17, 12:37 PM - William Welles: 😂
11/1/17, 12:37 PM - DL Tashjian: I'm into monk stuff
11/1/17, 12:38 PM - William Welles: Make beer, copy manuscripts, protect ancient knowledge from being lost
11/1/17, 12:39 PM - DL Tashjian: That would be a great game too
11/1/17, 12:40 PM - Miles Gilbert: Same on the jump button. Gotta have one.
11/1/17, 12:40 PM - DL Tashjian: Did any of you guys play Journey?
11/1/17, 12:41 PM - William Welles: Meghan loved it
11/1/17, 12:41 PM - DL Tashjian: Am i a bro for thinking that concept, while not remotely fleshed out enough was v. nice
11/1/17, 12:41 PM - William Welles: I haven’t played it
11/1/17, 12:41 PM - DL Tashjian: ok cool
11/1/17, 12:41 PM - DL Tashjian: i was a huge huge fan
11/1/17, 12:41 PM - DL Tashjian: it could have had so much more scope though
11/1/17, 12:44 PM - Michael Lindsay: Ur a bro DL but not bc of that
11/1/17, 12:44 PM - Michael Lindsay: Bc ur a good guy
11/1/17, 12:44 PM - DL Tashjian: thnx mike
11/1/17, 12:45 PM - DL Tashjian: william in your monk game, are you the only monk in the monastery or are you controlling otro monks?
11/1/17, 12:46 PM - Miles Gilbert: A monk among monks
11/1/17, 12:46 PM - Miles Gilbert: Is that title of the game
11/1/17, 12:47 PM - Miles Gilbert: A monk among monks runs amok
11/1/17, 12:48 PM - DL Tashjian: if only that was a palindrome
11/1/17, 12:49 PM - Michael Lindsay: I imagine an important part of the experience of being a monk is the lack of control, which being all the monks might miss
11/1/17, 12:51 PM - Michael Lindsay: A monk? No, ma
11/1/17, 12:51 PM - DL Tashjian: hahaha
11/1/17, 1:11 PM - Adam Polonski: Yea monks are gonna monk, you gotta be the Abbot and just make sure they have the room they need to pray, grow carrots, and save civilization
11/1/17, 1:11 PM - Michael Lindsay: You start as the Abbot?
11/1/17, 1:12 PM - Adam Polonski: Dunno, it might be more fun to just spend your time chopping carrots. How does the praying mechanic work
11/1/17, 1:14 PM - William Welles: fun running a monastery
11/1/17, 1:15 PM - William Welles: keep it defended from villains... make food... pray enough to win the end game
11/1/17, 1:17 PM - Adam Polonski: Yea I'm with will
11/1/17, 1:17 PM - William Welles: there's this movie about monks taking a vow of silence... a documentary and one day a year they can talk and like all they talk about is their hand washing policy in the bathroom...
11/1/17, 1:17 PM - William Welles: theres somethign to that
11/1/17, 1:17 PM - William Welles: silent monks... you play the one day a year they can communicate and oyu have to take care of buisiness for the next year
11/1/17, 1:17 PM - Adam Polonski: Into great silence. One of my top 10 movies
11/1/17, 1:25 PM - Michael Lindsay: I don't see the starting as an Abbot thing myself. I imagine the key part of being an Abbot is the all and respect you feel for the way a monastery operates and the people inside it. If you start the game as one, you haven't earned that. The game starts in my head with you leaving home with a rucksack and choosing whether to go down the road towards monastery of a few different orders and knowing the rules associated with those orders. And I think the end of game is dying, not praying to some amount
11/1/17, 1:25 PM - DL Tashjian: Oooooo
11/1/17, 1:26 PM - DL Tashjian: You had me at rucksack
11/1/17, 1:27 PM - William Welles: the order is more important than the life of a monk the majesty is in the harmony across generations
11/1/17, 1:27 PM - Michael Lindsay: Honestly, I think what we should do is figure out how to get in touch with the solo creator of stardew valley and tell him we'd like to be his research team. We don't actually know how to make video games ourselves
11/1/17, 1:27 PM - Michael Lindsay: Except Miles
11/1/17, 1:28 PM - Michael Lindsay: Will, I don't think your life as a player is important. I think that's important
11/1/17, 1:29 PM - William Welles: huh
11/1/17, 1:32 PM - Adam Polonski: I'm with will. It's about creating a monastery that can last and be self sustaining for a thousand years. Cut corners on copying manuscripts for five decades because you're rebuilding the walls after a viking or saracen raid? Oops, there goes the last copy of song of Roland
11/1/17, 1:33 PM - Michael Lindsay: So you're more ck2 than Stardew
11/1/17, 1:34 PM - Adam Polonski: I want it to feel like both though, you are living daily life and also creating something multigenerational at the same time
11/1/17, 1:34 PM - William Welles: i don't think CK2... myself
11/1/17, 1:34 PM - William Welles: intimate not grand
11/1/17, 1:34 PM - Adam Polonski: Yea
11/1/17, 1:38 PM - William Welles: like very intimate, spiritual, worker placement, w/ sim touches as you are a monk yourself not a faceless overlord
11/1/17, 1:41 PM - William Welles: need to know the monks in your monastery... it might be difficult to get some to build walls when all they are inspired to do is pray
11/1/17, 1:42 PM - DL Tashjian: I mean it's really great because since they don't talk you can direct and influence other monks with gestures
11/1/17, 1:43 PM - Adam Polonski: And then big decisions like - do you implement a vow of sikence or not, and what does that do for morale / piety / productivity
11/1/17, 1:43 PM - William Welles: hahaha thats a great idae
11/1/17, 1:43 PM - William Welles: idk the gesture idea is really cool as like a core mechanic too
11/1/17, 1:44 PM - William Welles: like journey kind of thing
11/1/17, 1:44 PM - William Welles: journey vibes
11/1/17, 1:44 PM - Adam Polonski: Omg please all go read the Wikipedia article "monastic sign languages"
11/1/17, 1:50 PM - Adam Polonski: So they really did have gestures that were basically like "go pray"  or "porridge"
11/1/17, 1:51 PM - William Welles: perfect hahahaha
11/1/17, 1:52 PM - Miles Gilbert: Lolol
11/1/17, 2:33 PM - DL Tashjian: lololol
11/1/17, 2:33 PM - DL Tashjian: which would be the A button? which would be Y?
11/1/17, 2:34 PM - Adam Polonski: Press A to Pray
11/1/17, 2:44 PM - William Welles: the game tells you at the opening that if you pray enough maybe god will answer.... then he never does 🤣
11/1/17, 2:44 PM - DL Tashjian: oh shittttttttt
11/1/17, 2:44 PM - DL Tashjian: i mean. do you want the ending to have reincarnation vibes?
11/1/17, 2:48 PM - William Welles: hmmmm maybe when you do the Buddhist or Hindu monk worlds???
11/1/17, 2:48 PM - DL Tashjian: hahaha
11/1/17, 2:49 PM - DL Tashjian: different ending for every order
11/1/17, 2:50 PM - Adam Polonski: My favorite ending is the one where you build an incredibly prosperous and successful monastery that becomes so lavish that Henry Viii dissolves it and steals all your shit
11/1/17, 2:52 PM - William Welles: hahahahaha
11/1/17, 2:52 PM - William Welles: Philip the Fair accuses your order or heresy so he can get that $$$$

11/2/17, 4:54 PM - Miles Gilbert: so much good internet today: http://www.messynessychic.com/2017/11/02/hedonist-hollywoods-lost-garden-of-allah
11/2/17, 4:54 PM - Miles Gilbert: There was never a dull moment at the Garden. “It Girl” Clara Bow was notorious for pushing hotel butlers off the diving boards and management looked the other way while the original Tarzan actor was said to have satisfied his numerous “Janes” in the hotel pool. One famous Broadway actress answered her bungalow door naked while her pet monkey collected telegrams from startled delivery boys. An inebriated American comedian and writer, Robert Benchley, would often have himself moved in a wheelbarrow between the villas’ endless parties.
11/2/17, 5:06 PM - Adam Polonski: Oh man sign me up
11/2/17, 5:08 PM - Michael Lindsay: How'd she get them on the diving board in the first place
11/2/17, 6:28 PM - Miles Gilbert: "oh Butler... Won't you kindly bring my cocktail to the end of the divin board for me so I can sip it and dip it? 💋"

"Why certainly, ma'am"

"Thank ya kindly 😈"

"Unhand me ma'am!"

11/7/17, 1:03 PM - Michael Lindsay: Disgusting opinion
11/7/17, 1:04 PM - Michael Lindsay: Jk but one of my fave experiences
11/7/17, 1:04 PM - Adam Polonski: Ending was good. But I still think about braid more but maybe that's just bcuz of odyssey
11/7/17, 1:11 PM - William Welles: Bc the point of braid was to subvert the trope that odyssey plays into?
11/7/17, 1:13 PM - Adam Polonski: No spoys
11/7/17, 1:14 PM - Michael Lindsay: Yeah will got hit in the brain or something and can no longer differentiate between spoy nonspoy

11/8/17, 9:22 PM - Adam Polonski: I heard that shit was great plus robot dinos
11/8/17, 9:22 PM - Miles Gilbert: It's not news I just never had anyone to talk to about cuz everyone was jerkin it to botw

11/8/17, 9:23 PM - DL Tashjian: Explain to me what Horizon zero Dawn is
11/8/17, 9:23 PM - Miles Gilbert: Botw had more style but hzd was more fun
11/8/17, 9:23 PM - DL Tashjian: What's the premise
11/8/17, 9:24 PM - Miles Gilbert: Pretty much same at botw lol
11/8/17, 9:25 PM - Miles Gilbert: Post apocalypse. You don't know what ended the world. There are machines running around the world.
11/8/17, 9:27 PM - DL Tashjian: Like Fallout?
11/8/17, 10:16 PM - Miles Gilbert: Nah. Like botw
11/9/17, 7:14 AM - William Welles: It looked like it played like another far cry which is why I never got into it but it was better?
11/9/17, 7:16 AM - Miles Gilbert: Imagine far cry but you actually have to think
11/9/17, 7:16 AM - Miles Gilbert: They really captured the idea of hunting
11/9/17, 7:16 AM - Miles Gilbert: Tracking, stalking and taking down prey
11/9/17, 7:16 AM - William Welles: Oh yeah that sounds good lol
11/9/17, 7:16 AM - William Welles: Problem w far cry is you just become an objective robot
11/9/17, 7:22 AM - DL Tashjian: I want no man's sky on the switch

11/10/17, 11:56 AM - Michael Lindsay: But also don't read this if you haven't played...
11/10/17, 11:57 AM - Adam Polonski: Yea the game spoiling itself is the dumbest thing ever
11/10/17, 11:58 AM - Adam Polonski: It really sucked when empire strike back revealed who Luke's father was (no spoilers in case you haven't seen it yet), totally spoiled the whole movie
11/10/17, 11:59 AM - Michael Lindsay: No... That's not what they mean
11/10/17, 12:00 PM - Adam Polonski: Dramatic exaggeration bucko
11/10/17, 12:00 PM - Michael Lindsay: Yeah but if Vader had been like "that kid doesn't even know I'm his dad" in the second act then it would be applicable
11/10/17, 12:05 PM - Adam Polonski: Fair
11/10/17, 12:07 PM - Adam Polonski: Which is practically how they plotted the whole prequels
11/10/17, 12:07 PM - Adam Polonski: Palpatine: heehee next I'll make Anakin do X to consolidate my power! (Later) Anakin does X

11/12/17, 11:23 AM - Michael Lindsay: And four controllers are possible too though I don't know the process
11/12/17, 11:24 AM - William Welles: You need some like blu tooth n64 controllers that shit won’t play right w a snes
11/12/17, 11:27 AM - DL Tashjian: I mean I played mariokart 64 on Wii controllers it was fine
11/12/17, 11:27 AM - DL Tashjian: Those were snes
11/12/17, 11:27 AM - DL Tashjian: The classics
11/12/17, 3:44 PM - DL Tashjian: Dudes. Gotta send my switch in kinda bummed
11/12/17, 3:44 PM - DL Tashjian: They said they try their hardest to keep all the data but they might not be able to
11/12/17, 3:45 PM - DL Tashjian: They recommend that I transfer my data to another switch
11/12/17, 3:45 PM - DL Tashjian: Anyone got a brother with a switch in Florida that wants to hold onto my data for a week
11/12/17, 3:45 PM - DL Tashjian: Imagine if I lost all my koroks
11/12/17, 3:47 PM - Michael Lindsay: 😩
11/12/17, 3:47 PM - DL Tashjian: Would u risk it and send it ib
11/12/17, 3:48 PM - Michael Lindsay: But what's wrong
11/12/17, 3:49 PM - DL Tashjian: The dock doesnt work
11/12/17, 3:49 PM - DL Tashjian: Never has
11/12/17, 3:49 PM - DL Tashjian: I got it to work on one tv
11/12/17, 3:50 PM - DL Tashjian: But they can't know if it's the switch or the dock unless I test it on another switch
11/12/17, 3:51 PM - DL Tashjian: This girl I work with has a kid that has one maybe her kid can test it out for me
11/12/17, 4:02 PM - Miles Gilbert: Damn that sucks dude
11/12/17, 4:40 PM - Adam Polonski: Oof that's a spicy meatball
11/12/17, 4:40 PM - Adam Polonski: My left joycon is fucked but that's minor by comparison. I need to get it a tinfoil hat
11/12/17, 4:41 PM - Adam Polonski: Personal emergency: my SO somehow hasn't seen any Arnold classics from the 90s. Do I start her with Total Recall or True Lies or Terminator?
11/12/17, 4:41 PM - Michael Lindsay: 😂nota
11/12/17, 4:41 PM - Michael Lindsay: Commando
11/12/17, 4:46 PM - DL Tashjian: Pumping iron
11/12/17, 4:46 PM - Miles Gilbert: Lol I just watched Eraser the other day. So bad. Felt good.
11/12/17, 4:46 PM - Miles Gilbert: I think true lies is a must
11/12/17, 4:47 PM - Miles Gilbert: Cuz like Terminator isn't really about Arnold
11/12/17, 4:47 PM - Miles Gilbert: I prefer to get some funny Arnold in. He's white charming.
11/12/17, 4:47 PM - Miles Gilbert: Quite
11/12/17, 4:47 PM - Michael Lindsay: 😂😂😂
11/12/17, 5:07 PM - Adam Polonski: Yea that was my instinct too Miles. Gotta get those goofs

11/13/17, 4:51 PM - Miles Gilbert: I agree with everything he's saying except I enjoyed hzd as u all know. I get a kick out the tried and true mechanic when it's well done and I think it was in that case. Anyway, I bought Odyssey earlier today 🤗
11/13/17, 4:51 PM - Michael Lindsay: 😱😱✊
11/13/17, 4:51 PM - Michael Lindsay: Prob doesn't help when you're professionally required to play every game with that mechanic
11/13/17, 4:52 PM - Miles Gilbert: True
11/13/17, 4:52 PM - Miles Gilbert: V v true
11/13/17, 4:52 PM - Michael Lindsay: Good luck saving the Princess!

11/13/17, 5:26 PM - DL Tashjian: Ok I caved on odyssey too guys
11/13/17, 5:26 PM - DL Tashjian: I do feel like the controls are lacking
11/13/17, 5:26 PM - Miles Gilbert: Dang Odyssey boyz
11/13/17, 5:26 PM - DL Tashjian: Why isn't there a run button
11/13/17, 5:26 PM - DL Tashjian: Without it I feel like I'm not tapping into full speed potwbtial
11/13/17, 5:28 PM - Michael Lindsay: Roll+shake is dat full speed. Didn't figure that out until 40 hours in
11/13/17, 5:37 PM - DL Tashjian: Love roll shake

11/14/17, 11:38 AM - Adam Polonski: That game was fun until I played against the AI on the easiest setting and lost by like 7 points and couldn't score once. In MP we were all terrible
11/14/17, 11:39 AM - Adam Polonski: How's Mario treating you so far

11/14/17, 2:09 PM - Miles Gilbert: looool
11/14/17, 6:55 PM - Miles Gilbert: Wow this some whacked out shit

11/14/17, 7:10 PM - DL Tashjian: It's fun
11/14/17, 7:10 PM - DL Tashjian: But it sux handheld
11/14/17, 7:11 PM - DL Tashjian: There's so many extra buttons that could have built an advanced hat throwing techniques without having to throw the handles around
11/14/17, 7:26 PM - Miles Gilbert: Super fun
11/14/17, 7:26 PM - Miles Gilbert: Playing on the tv

11/14/17, 8:01 PM - Michael Lindsay: Comey is clearly Snape imo
11/14/17, 8:04 PM - William Welles: The biggest lesson of 2016 is that there are no harry potters
11/14/17, 8:04 PM - William Welles: Hot take guys
11/14/17, 8:11 PM - Miles Gilbert: Cmon
11/14/17, 8:11 PM - Miles Gilbert: There's gotta be!
11/14/17, 8:11 PM - William Welles: No one will save us the people must organize and save themselves!
11/14/17, 8:11 PM - William Welles: We are all a tiny piece of Harry Potter
11/14/17, 8:11 PM - William Welles: Waiting to unite and form!
11/14/17, 8:11 PM - Miles Gilbert: Ooooooooo

11/14/17, 8:22 PM - Adam Polonski: 80% confidence that Bannon is Nagini
11/14/17, 8:45 PM - DL Tashjian: I agree w will
11/14/17, 8:46 PM - DL Tashjian: HP is the embodiment of not only the millennial plight... But also the fact that no one can save us we gotta make Dumbledores army and do it ourselves
11/15/17, 8:14 AM - William Welles: Nice DL!
11/15/17, 8:16 AM - Miles Gilbert: ✊✊
11/15/17, 8:42 AM - Miles Gilbert: You guys ever think about participating in a game jam?
11/15/17, 8:42 AM - Michael Lindsay: Que es esto
11/15/17, 8:43 AM - DL Tashjian: what is a game jam
11/15/17, 8:43 AM - DL Tashjian: space jam?
11/15/17, 8:43 AM - Miles Gilbert: A quick Sprint to create a game on a central theme. Can be anywhere from a weekend to two weeks
11/15/17, 8:43 AM - Miles Gilbert: https://itch.io/jam/greek-mytholojam
11/15/17, 8:43 AM - Michael Lindsay: I would do it. Done many startup weekends
11/15/17, 8:43 AM - William Welles: That sounds awesome
11/15/17, 8:44 AM - William Welles: Do you need to know how to code?
11/15/17, 8:44 AM - Michael Lindsay: Typically no but coders are highly desirable
11/15/17, 8:46 AM - Miles Gilbert: We should just do it and I'll do the coding. If it's shit it doesn't matter.
11/15/17, 8:47 AM - Miles Gilbert: The itchio Jams are not in person so nothing to lose
11/15/17, 8:47 AM - Michael Lindsay: Well I assume you gotta be local
11/15/17, 8:47 AM - Michael Lindsay: Oh. Interesting
11/15/17, 8:47 AM - Miles Gilbert: You just submit
11/15/17, 8:47 AM - William Welles: Oh word. But you’d wanna Jam in person I’d imagine right?
11/15/17, 8:48 AM - Miles Gilbert: We can work up to that but I think this could be a good intro
11/15/17, 8:50 AM - DL Tashjian: rad
11/15/17, 8:51 AM - William Welles: That would be so cool
11/15/17, 8:55 AM - Miles Gilbert: A lot of these games are like 2 hours playtime. Keep it simple. Just get a toe in.
11/15/17, 9:11 AM - William Welles: and probably especially simple for some first slimers
11/15/17, 9:15 AM - William Welles: I might have a pretty cool concept for a super simple greek themed game
11/15/17, 9:19 AM - William Welles: would you want to try this one miles or is it better to find one in the future so it can be planned a bit before it starts
11/15/17, 9:20 AM - DL Tashjian: i have an idea for an emo themed greek game wanna hear it?
11/15/17, 9:46 AM - Miles Gilbert: fuck.. i really wanna do it, but i'm trying to be more careful with my time and not take on too much :(
11/15/17, 9:46 AM - Miles Gilbert: i'd love to hear your ideas tho
11/15/17, 9:47 AM - DL Tashjian: I wanna hear your idea Will
11/15/17, 9:51 AM - William Welles: well this was without much thought just while I was biking over - but I was trying to think of an aspect of greece that wasn't played out. Anyway in the numerous times the Persians tried to invade greece by building a giant pontoon bridge over this dangerous stretch of water. So I thought it would be fun to be the engineers trying to keep the bridge functional as it is breaking apart from rough water, troops going over, attacks by the greeks. so it would be like classic arcade game feel very simple running around trying to keep the bridge operational for as long as possible (scoring by like amount of troops that cross). basically I played "tapper" at an arcade a few months ago and loved it- that type of frantic hold it togetehr as long as possible playstyle
11/15/17, 9:51 AM - William Welles: <Media omitted>
11/15/17, 9:51 AM - Michael Lindsay: 👌
11/15/17, 9:55 AM - DL Tashjian: im into it
11/15/17, 9:55 AM - DL Tashjian: but also.
11/15/17, 9:55 AM - DL Tashjian: i really want to play tapper
11/15/17, 9:56 AM - William Welles: its SO good - dunno if it would hold up on like a computer but on the machine it was great... the tapper thrower thing has an amazing feel
11/15/17, 9:56 AM - DL Tashjian: looks like your bar isnt that popular tho
11/15/17, 9:56 AM - William Welles: I got 6th on the all time leaderboard and meghan wouldnt stop till she beat me at 5 lol
11/15/17, 10:00 AM - DL Tashjian: sick
11/15/17, 10:04 AM - Miles Gilbert: hahaha
11/15/17, 10:05 AM - Miles Gilbert: thats awesome
11/15/17, 10:05 AM - Miles Gilbert: i like the idea... its very complex
11/15/17, 10:06 AM - Miles Gilbert: well.. i guess it doesn't have to be
11/15/17, 10:06 AM - William Welles: oh I thought it was simple lol - I might not know what is simple and complex from a programming perspective 😂
11/15/17, 10:06 AM - Miles Gilbert: yea... i dunno, i should play some tapper
11/15/17, 10:07 AM - Miles Gilbert: since there's no physics involved, i could code it in javascript, which i'm pretty good at
11/15/17, 10:07 AM - Miles Gilbert: much better than Unity/C++
11/15/17, 10:07 AM - Miles Gilbert: could you think about some of the specific mechanics that would keep the bridge up?
11/15/17, 10:07 AM - Miles Gilbert: like... Add Wood
11/15/17, 10:07 AM - Miles Gilbert: lol
11/15/17, 10:07 AM - William Welles: yeah lol
11/15/17, 10:08 AM - William Welles: ill flesh out some mechanic ideas
11/15/17, 10:09 AM - William Welles: I think using tapper as like a base is smart though - then like thinking of how to expand / differentiate
11/15/17, 10:09 AM - William Welles: the tapper version is like you fend off greek ships from hurting the bridge but I like the build mechanic more
11/15/17, 10:09 AM - William Welles: /repair
11/15/17, 10:10 AM - William Welles: but if it was actually both it could be really hectic
11/15/17, 10:12 AM - William Welles: if there are multiple lanes... greek ships come down you have to shoot them back... but also like debris comes down hurting the bridge and you have to go to the section and mash repair
11/15/17, 10:13 AM - William Welles: but thats just top of hte head I'll give it some thought when my boss isn't getting mad at me for not working like right now lol
11/15/17, 10:15 AM - Miles Gilbert: you have a boss?
11/15/17, 10:16 AM - William Welles: I’m doing this assistant editor gig for 8 weeks
11/15/17, 10:16 AM - DL Tashjian: you gotta get some columns in there
11/15/17, 10:16 AM - Miles Gilbert: ah cool
11/15/17, 10:16 AM - Miles Gilbert: is it cool?
11/15/17, 10:17 AM - William Welles: Errmm not so much cool. But I was in desperate need of income
11/15/17, 10:17 AM - Miles Gilbert: feel u
11/15/17, 10:17 AM - William Welles: DL what was your idea ?
11/15/17, 10:17 AM - DL Tashjian: i didn't hash it out fully but it was a joke
11/15/17, 10:18 AM - DL Tashjian: basically your gf dumps you so you run around to all these shrines and pray to gods to smite her new bf
11/15/17, 10:18 AM - William Welles: 😂
11/15/17, 10:19 AM - DL Tashjian: i just really picture a really great emo soundtrack
11/15/17, 10:19 AM - Miles Gilbert: lol
11/15/17, 10:19 AM - Miles Gilbert: this song will become the anthem of your underground
11/15/17, 10:19 AM - DL Tashjian: hahahah exactly
11/15/17, 10:21 AM - DL Tashjian: remember that vid
11/15/17, 10:21 AM - DL Tashjian: Miles are you liking mario odyssey
11/15/17, 10:22 AM - Adam Polonski: Late to the thread but I love the Greek bridge idea too!
11/15/17, 10:22 AM - Miles Gilbert: liking it yeah... stayed up late and finished the desert kingdom boss last night... it's super fluid and easier than i thought it would be. but I HAAAATE the bullet bill sections
11/15/17, 10:23 AM - Miles Gilbert: overall, im not gushing like most people, but pretty into it
11/15/17, 10:23 AM - Adam Polonski: Remember when Xerxes threw chains into the sea and had it whipped with a hundred lashes to show the sea who was boss? That should be the ending. Or the opening
11/15/17, 10:23 AM - DL Tashjian: I totally feel the same way
11/15/17, 10:23 AM - William Welles: Yeah that plays in like 8 bit graphics when you lose
11/15/17, 10:23 AM - Miles Gilbert: haha super dramatic
11/15/17, 10:25 AM - DL Tashjian: eventually do the ships send out launch boats to the bottom of the bridges and dudes start laddering up them and then get on the bridge and start knocking your peops into the sea?
11/15/17, 10:25 AM - DL Tashjian: bc that would be some p cool imagery your peops all raining down into the sea and you can't save em until you knock off the pirates
11/15/17, 10:25 AM - Miles Gilbert: do u have a link to like and ancient scroll for a reference image?
11/15/17, 10:27 AM - William Welles: <Media omitted>
11/15/17, 10:27 AM - William Welles: this was the most common style
11/15/17, 10:27 AM - William Welles: but very 2d...
11/15/17, 10:29 AM - Miles Gilbert: gonna need some help with art
11/15/17, 10:29 AM - Miles Gilbert: mike, you're pretty well versed in pixel art after your pokemon project
11/15/17, 10:30 AM - Adam Polonski: Oh man if we could do art like that it would be awesome
11/15/17, 10:31 AM - William Welles: i would guess nearly top down pixel is the best way to view bridge and have play area
11/15/17, 10:31 AM - Miles Gilbert: the only person we know who could do it is ege
11/15/17, 10:31 AM - William Welles: which is hard to mesh with the head on 2d style of the pottery but idk
11/15/17, 10:32 AM - Miles Gilbert: <Media omitted>
11/15/17, 10:32 AM - Miles Gilbert: could be like that... Geoff McFetridge style
11/15/17, 10:32 AM - Miles Gilbert: but more outliney
11/15/17, 10:32 AM - Miles Gilbert: and pottery colors
11/15/17, 10:33 AM - Miles Gilbert: it would be super cool to have it all in the black and terra cotta palette at least
11/15/17, 10:33 AM - William Welles: guys
11/15/17, 10:34 AM - William Welles: <Media omitted>
11/15/17, 10:35 AM - DL Tashjian: Mcfetridge style would be amaze
11/15/17, 10:37 AM - William Welles: <Media omitted>
11/15/17, 10:38 AM - DL Tashjian: what is the perspective. are you a playable character or just like moving around a cursor?
11/15/17, 10:39 AM - Miles Gilbert: i think in order to be realistic in terms of doability... you are an unseen character with a birds eye view of the river
11/15/17, 10:43 AM - William Welles: <Media omitted>
11/15/17, 10:44 AM - Miles Gilbert: haha i like that
11/15/17, 10:44 AM - Miles Gilbert: what was that old game that was in the medieval style.. it was like on newgrounds.de or somethingawful.com
11/15/17, 10:45 AM - Miles Gilbert: Doeth a barrel roll
11/15/17, 10:45 AM - DL Tashjian: So how do you control actions? how are you fending off shipz
11/15/17, 10:45 AM - Miles Gilbert: anyway... i'm into that
11/15/17, 10:45 AM - DL Tashjian: im all about that crab
11/15/17, 10:46 AM - Miles Gilbert: so i think for simplicity... there's a series of buttons at the end of each bridge.. kinda off the main screen... you click them to like Add Wood or whatever
11/15/17, 10:46 AM - Miles Gilbert: and the actions have refresh periods
11/15/17, 10:46 AM - Miles Gilbert: and cost money
11/15/17, 10:46 AM - Miles Gilbert: or labor
11/15/17, 10:46 AM - Miles Gilbert: and you could like upgrade them or earn new actions
11/15/17, 10:46 AM - DL Tashjian: and you get money by fending off attacks?
11/15/17, 10:47 AM - Miles Gilbert: maybe if you sink a certain type of ship it drops TREASURE
11/15/17, 10:47 AM - DL Tashjian: maybe some special attacks?
11/15/17, 10:47 AM - William Welles: i was thinking even simpler.... mash button on location for repair... press button or flick to shoot at boats
11/15/17, 10:47 AM - William Welles: you are maybe a scaffolding that moves across bridge
11/15/17, 10:47 AM - DL Tashjian: like a lightning bold that clears off an entire bridge? or is that lame
11/15/17, 10:47 AM - Miles Gilbert: that's cool will
11/15/17, 10:48 AM - DL Tashjian: yeha
11/15/17, 10:48 AM - Miles Gilbert: yea, DL i think there could be a big special attack
11/15/17, 10:49 AM - William Welles: It makes sense to me that for this first iteration sticking to arcade style will be helpful. Like all about reaction time not resource management.
11/15/17, 10:50 AM - William Welles: Yeah. Maybe something you can grab but it’s hard to grab so like... you risk other stuff falling apart during that time
11/15/17, 10:51 AM - DL Tashjian: agreed
11/15/17, 10:52 AM - DL Tashjian: But def you build up resources for a few special attacks
11/15/17, 10:52 AM - DL Tashjian: or they just get randomly dropped
11/15/17, 10:54 AM - William Welles: Maybe randomly priests appear at your end of the bridge and you have to stay there and pray to get the lightning. But you can fuck it up bc wholenthats happening you aren’t repairing / fighting
11/15/17, 10:56 AM - DL Tashjian: whoosh that sounds like a total gamble
11/15/17, 10:56 AM - DL Tashjian: like do you want to get lightning and risk it all
11/15/17, 10:57 AM - William Welles: exactly
11/15/17, 10:57 AM - DL Tashjian: hahahaha
11/15/17, 10:57 AM - DL Tashjian: but if youw ant to go to a preist and pray you have to be a person
11/15/17, 10:58 AM - William Welles: i think maybe youre like a 'team of engineers' and you dont run anywhere you want there are like 7 spots for each pontoon along bridge or whatever... and like tapper you go btwn them...
11/15/17, 11:00 AM - DL Tashjian: def
11/15/17, 11:00 AM - DL Tashjian: what do greek engineers look like tho?
11/15/17, 11:02 AM - William Welles: well they'd be persian
11/15/17, 11:10 AM - DL Tashjian: what do persian engineers look like
11/15/17, 11:10 AM - William Welles: probably pretty hot
11/15/17, 11:10 AM - DL Tashjian: haha nice
11/15/17, 11:10 AM - DL Tashjian: are there going to be like streets of rage cut scenes?

11/15/17, 6:54 PM - William Welles: Gotta but bro
11/15/17, 7:08 PM - DL Tashjian: Spoiler
11/15/17, 7:09 PM - DL Tashjian: I'm just at the crucial fork in the road deciding btwn lake and woods
11/15/17, 7:09 PM - DL Tashjian: Which way should I go ?!?!?!
11/15/17, 7:32 PM - Michael Lindsay: What did you choose
11/15/17, 7:36 PM - DL Tashjian: Lake
11/15/17, 7:37 PM - Miles Gilbert: Ooo I went woods
11/15/17, 7:37 PM - DL Tashjian: I found out that the broozers are there
11/15/17, 7:40 PM - Miles Gilbert: Whomst is they
11/15/17, 7:50 PM - DL Tashjian: Is that what the rabbit people are called
11/15/17, 7:53 PM - Miles Gilbert: Rabbids?
11/15/17, 7:54 PM - DL Tashjian: Are they rabbids?
11/15/17, 7:54 PM - DL Tashjian: The bosses?
11/15/17, 7:55 PM - Adam Polonski: Broodals because they're a brutal brood
11/15/17, 7:55 PM - Miles Gilbert: I don't know enough about rabbid cannon
11/15/17, 7:55 PM - DL Tashjian: <Media omitted>
11/15/17, 7:55 PM - Adam Polonski: Pretty into the girl broodal and the hayseed broodal
11/15/17, 7:55 PM - DL Tashjian: Sorry broodals
11/15/17, 7:55 PM - Miles Gilbert: Oh I thought that was a play on bridal
11/15/17, 7:55 PM - Adam Polonski: Maybe that too!
11/15/17, 7:56 PM - Miles Gilbert: So many layers
11/15/17, 8:01 PM - DL Tashjian: Ohhhhhh I get it
11/15/17, 10:29 PM - William Welles: Koopa kids are better controversial opinion
11/16/17, 6:10 AM - Adam Polonski: Generally agree. Broodals aren't as bad as I expected though because they're at least all different. So they're better than just Bowser jr but not as good as all the koopa kids
11/16/17, 7:22 AM - William Welles: They’ve been overusing bowser jr for sure

11/16/17, 1:32 PM - William Welles: price tag might be prohibitive for me for a 6 year old game i've alreadhy played though
11/16/17, 1:32 PM - Michael Lindsay: It's the thought that counts
11/16/17, 1:33 PM - William Welles: if i were about to pop like a 6+ hour flight though....
11/16/17, 2:01 PM - Adam Polonski: I never even beat it because I did too much other stuff over hundreds of hours so... Worth one more revisit
11/16/17, 2:02 PM - William Welles: maybe a strict mage game
11/16/17, 2:02 PM - William Welles: old school made not a multi-class mush like the game encourages
11/16/17, 2:06 PM - Miles Gilbert: i stopped playing it cuz i got vampirism like 1 hour into playing it... but i didn't know i had vampirism until much later, so i just thought the game was super hard
11/16/17, 2:06 PM - William Welles: hahahaha
11/16/17, 2:06 PM - William Welles: thats a great way to play
11/16/17, 2:06 PM - Miles Gilbert: i was like, "why can't i go outside?? this game sucks"
11/16/17, 2:06 PM - William Welles: I wanna be a vamp wizard
11/16/17, 2:06 PM - William Welles: omg
11/16/17, 2:06 PM - William Welles: its an inside game
11/16/17, 2:06 PM - Miles Gilbert: lol
11/16/17, 2:07 PM - Miles Gilbert: impossible
11/16/17, 2:07 PM - Miles Gilbert: i guess that's worth a second playthrough

11/26/17, 11:38 AM - Miles Gilbert: Scathing pocket animal crossing review from @chrissyteigen: pocket animal crossing might be okay for you AC newbies but for us tom nook loyalists it is merely a hit of the crack that is actual, real, animal crossing. It lacks the heart. The soul. It's a sandwich with no meat. A car without tires.

11/29/17, 11:40 AM - DL Tashjian: I think I've decided that overall I prefer Zelda to Mario
11/29/17, 11:40 AM - DL Tashjian: But the controls in Mario are much more fun
11/29/17, 11:41 AM - DL Tashjian: I wish they'd make like an ever expanding shadow of the colossus like game for switch
11/29/17, 11:41 AM - William Welles: I like Zelda more overalll too mostly bc I’m more into the vibes
11/29/17, 11:43 AM - Miles Gilbert: same
11/29/17, 11:43 AM - Miles Gilbert: but i like mario for its quick playability...i played for an hour last night and felt like i accomplished a lot
11/29/17, 11:43 AM - Miles Gilbert: whereas in zelda.. an hour might only get me through like 2 harder shrines or a quest
11/29/17, 3:22 PM - DL Tashjian: agreed
11/29/17, 5:21 PM - Adam Polonski: Also agreed. Loved playing on a 2 hour and ride and getting dozens and dozens of moons. Made me feel like hot shit

12/1/17, 10:41 AM - Adam Polonski: Weird story but sharing it anyway. Last night I dreamed I was catching the NYC subway back from Jerusalem (??) but kept getting attacked by suicide bombers of various persuasions. I survived and escaped to a large underground chamber where I was attacked by another suicide bomber WHO WAS ALSO A DRAGON. I held him off in a siege but woke up before defeating him. Two questions, could I defeat a suicide bomber winged dragon in real life, and why did I drink so much at the liquor lobby's holiday party and have weird ass dreams
12/1/17, 10:42 AM - DL Tashjian: You sure you weren't chasing that dragon
12/1/17, 10:42 AM - DL Tashjian: 🐉

1/6/18, 9:20 AM - William Welles: The first two vids you posted mike are actually from ground zeroes not phantom pain. The self contained prequel that came out a few months before
1/7/18, 11:53 AM - DL Tashjian: https://www.zeldadungeon.net/rumor-a-new-zelda-game-is-coming-to-the-3ds-in-2018/

“It's straight up impossible,” Yagnow told me, pointing to the 2,599 attempts he made, trying to bend the hole to his will.

When I showed the image to Smith, he called it a "a classic impossible hole."
1/8/18, 9:58 PM - Michael Lindsay: guy in the video made 25k attempts at a mk64 level
1/8/18, 9:58 PM - Michael Lindsay: also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT0kXWd4jV0
1/8/18, 9:59 PM - Miles Gilbert: Jesuz
1/11/18, 12:34 PM - Michael Lindsay: Anyone played super meat boy? Out on switch. Is it basically N+? Bang your head against wall type game?
1/11/18, 12:37 PM - Adam Polonski: Yes it's brutal and for me too hard to be fun
1/11/18, 12:37 PM - Adam Polonski: I much preferred the 3ds game VVVVVV
1/11/18, 12:38 PM - Adam Polonski: Also hard but less punishing about it
1/11/18, 12:38 PM - Michael Lindsay: Ok fuck that
1/11/18, 12:38 PM - Michael Lindsay: Dragon quest builders demo out today. Minecraft+rpg

1/11/18, 12:44 PM - Michael Lindsay: Yes
1/11/18, 7:55 PM - Michael Lindsay: Might as well share my lame opinion. I think botw was my game of the year and I think Odyssey ranks higher on my games of all time list
1/11/18, 9:12 PM - William Welles: splain
1/11/18, 9:12 PM - DL Tashjian: I still have to beat Mario
1/11/18, 9:12 PM - DL Tashjian: But Michael id agree with you under the stipulation that it's for television play
1/11/18, 9:12 PM - DL Tashjian: Portable Mario isn't half as fun
1/11/18, 9:13 PM - DL Tashjian: So I gravitate towards Zelda
1/11/18, 9:48 PM - Michael Lindsay: The explanation is that zelda was mind-blowing moreso but that I already think Zelda 2 will be the better game. Odyssey might be the best platformer I've ever played and may never be exceeded. In ten years if someone's like which games should I play, I expect I'll say Odyssey and Zelda 2 and not botw
1/11/18, 9:55 PM - DL Tashjian: I can get down to that
1/11/18, 10:57 PM - William Welles: hard to imagine any console that had two games this good in their first year
1/11/18, 10:57 PM - William Welles: mario 64 and OoT?
1/11/18, 10:57 PM - Michael Lindsay: oot was over a year later i think
1/11/18, 10:58 PM - Michael Lindsay: so was smash, but maybe not goldeneye
1/11/18, 10:58 PM - William Welles: yeah youre right
1/11/18, 10:58 PM - William Welles: FFX and GTA 3 on ps2 maybe...
1/11/18, 10:58 PM - William Welles: lol
1/11/18, 10:58 PM - William Welles: either way pretty stunning and rare
1/11/18, 10:58 PM - Michael Lindsay: halo + smething?
1/11/18, 10:59 PM - William Welles: halo and cel damage :D
1/11/18, 10:59 PM - William Welles: halo and halo
1/11/18, 10:59 PM - Michael Lindsay: goldeneye was within a year, so that is on the same level imo
1/11/18, 10:59 PM - William Welles: yeah thats true
1/11/18, 11:00 PM - DL Tashjian: Ridge racer and xtreme games

1/11/18, 11:01 PM - William Welles: morrowind is amazing
1/11/18, 11:01 PM - Miles Gilbert: Jet grind radio and soul caliber on Dreamcast
1/11/18, 11:01 PM - William Welles: no game blew my mind like that one when it came out
1/11/18, 11:01 PM - Miles Gilbert: 🍥
1/11/18, 11:01 PM - Michael Lindsay: i mean did it release within 1 year of console release
1/11/18, 11:01 PM - William Welles: imagine how you felt when you first played oblivion but then wind it back 5 years and there was no game like it ever
1/11/18, 11:01 PM - William Welles: 2002?
1/11/18, 11:01 PM - William Welles: console popped 2001

1/11/18, 11:28 PM - William Welles: Ps2 was an insanely good console
1/11/18, 11:28 PM - Michael Lindsay: could've brought it MORE but the problem for this exercise is no one knew what to do in the first year dev-wise
1/11/18, 11:28 PM - William Welles: Yeah and like the non 1-1 tracking was super limiting. Took great creativity to use it well
1/11/18, 11:29 PM - William Welles: I want a new Okami game on switch

1/12/18, 9:15 AM - DL Tashjian: Maybe not better graphics lol
1/12/18, 9:15 AM - Adam Polonski: Speaking of watersports, literally all I want is for N64 Mini to happen so I can play the fuck out of Wave Race again
1/12/18, 9:15 AM - Michael Lindsay: We're not talking about feel, we're talking about best 1-2 punch of games

1/12/18, 9:31 AM - Miles Gilbert: coolboarders was so fast... u could do like a 2400 degree rotation like nothing... 1080 slowed things down a bit in a good way

1/12/18, 9:51 AM - William Welles: I can’t sing morrowinds praises enough
1/12/18, 9:52 AM - Michael Lindsay: make ur list then
1/12/18, 9:52 AM - William Welles: The future games oblivion and Skyrim limited the player more every time. Morrow you could like craft any spell
1/12/18, 9:53 AM - William Welles: One of the first things in the game is you’re walking through the woods and a person falls out of the sky and dies in front of you. And you find a potion on him and if you use it you can jump so high you see the whole map but the potion has nothing to help you survive the landing.
1/12/18, 9:53 AM - William Welles: And it’s not some like dumb one off oblivion thing you could craft that
1/12/18, 9:54 AM - William Welles: No npcs we’re immortal
1/12/18, 9:54 AM - William Welles: Mark canning killed everyone in morrowind w a sword that made their bodies burn forever
1/12/18, 9:54 AM - Michael Lindsay: yeah but moments alone do not put a game in a tier, you gotta take the package
1/12/18, 9:55 AM - Michael Lindsay: 😂😂😂😂😂
1/12/18, 9:56 AM - William Welles: Well the building all looked like fucking bug cacoons does that put something in S tier????
1/12/18, 9:56 AM - William Welles: Answer = yes
1/12/18, 9:56 AM - Michael Lindsay: it's guaranteed s-tier, is it sss-tier
1/12/18, 9:57 AM - William Welles: Highest elder scrolls for sure
1/12/18, 9:57 AM - William Welles: If sss tier means it has to remain very playable through all time then maybe no....
1/12/18, 9:57 AM - William Welles: But then gta 3 wouldn’t be either
1/12/18, 9:58 AM - Michael Lindsay: no, i think goldeneye and halo and probably gta3 are not still playable at that level
1/12/18, 9:58 AM - William Welles: Halo maybe actually
1/12/18, 9:58 AM - William Welles: But goldeneye morrow and gta3 were best games of their time but don’t remain playable later
1/12/18, 9:58 AM - Michael Lindsay: halo is harder to play than goldeneye i would say
1/12/18, 9:58 AM - William Welles: Lol you’re thinking of halo 2
1/12/18, 9:58 AM - William Welles: But mayb
1/12/18, 9:58 AM - Michael Lindsay: ? halo 2 is much more playable
1/12/18, 9:59 AM - William Welles: The main object of halo 2 is its a mystery game about figuring out which direction to walk
1/12/18, 9:59 AM - William Welles: Very disagree
1/12/18, 9:59 AM - Michael Lindsay: halo is like trying to move throuh molasses with a lobotomy, goldeneye is more coherent
1/12/18, 9:59 AM - DL Tashjian: Remember the zombies game we'd play
1/12/18, 9:59 AM - DL Tashjian: That was epic
1/12/18, 9:59 AM - Michael Lindsay: actually i'm thinking multiplayer, halo single player is pretty playable
1/12/18, 9:59 AM - William Welles: Also RE4
1/12/18, 9:59 AM - DL Tashjian: That was the most fun multiplayer sessions I've ever had
1/12/18, 10:00 AM - William Welles: Oh I was thinking singleton
1/12/18, 10:00 AM - DL Tashjian: Even more than smash in the senior room
1/12/18, 10:00 AM - Michael Lindsay: which game dl?
1/12/18, 10:00 AM - DL Tashjian: Playing zombie (I think Halo 3)
1/12/18, 10:00 AM - DL Tashjian: Multiple screens
1/12/18, 10:00 AM - William Welles: Yeah
1/12/18, 10:00 AM - DL Tashjian: So so so so so so much fun
1/12/18, 10:00 AM - William Welles: Zombies halo was so scary
1/12/18, 10:00 AM - DL Tashjian: Totes
1/12/18, 10:00 AM - DL Tashjian: Was that some custom gameplay you guys made?
1/12/18, 10:01 AM - Michael Lindsay: i dont recall this yet
1/12/18, 10:03 AM - William Welles: Yeah you had to tweak out the custom settings
1/12/18, 10:03 AM - William Welles: I think they added it to halo 3 but the custom way in H2 was much better
1/12/18, 10:03 AM - William Welles: Or maybe 4 and 3 I mean
1/12/18, 10:03 AM - William Welles: I have no idea
1/12/18, 10:10 AM - Miles Gilbert: Yea it was custom and then added to a later game as a multi game type
1/12/18, 10:11 AM - Miles Gilbert: I remember being one of the last humans and just tooling around in a warty running over zombies. So fun
1/12/18, 10:11 AM - William Welles: I do miss games just having like weird setting options for shit like that instead of everything being so clean and packaged
1/12/18, 10:11 AM - Miles Gilbert: Tru
1/12/18, 10:11 AM - William Welles: But maybe that’s what you get with like CoD which I have found unplayable since modern warfare
1/12/18, 10:12 AM - Miles Gilbert: Speaking of replaying, have u guys played GTA v in first person mode. Actually changes the game a lot
1/12/18, 10:12 AM - William Welles: I think I tried and just crashed 100 times
1/12/18, 10:12 AM - Miles Gilbert: Lol
1/12/18, 10:12 AM - Miles Gilbert: Yea it's hard but so intense
1/12/18, 10:12 AM - William Welles: I could go for a gta V revisit
1/12/18, 10:12 AM - William Welles: Haven’t played since we beat it
1/12/18, 10:16 AM - Miles Gilbert: It holds up
1/12/18, 10:16 AM - Miles Gilbert: I might be wrong, but I think they improved graphics and added cars
1/12/18, 10:16 AM - Miles Gilbert: Plus there's all the new online stuff, but its still impossible to join a game online
1/12/18, 12:17 PM - Miles Gilbert: Ok. What was the first system you bought with ur own money
1/12/18, 12:19 PM - Miles Gilbert: Mine is hilarious and will probably knows it

1/12/18, 12:25 PM - Michael Lindsay: lolll

1/22/18, 12:54 PM - Michael Lindsay: A man has to learn his horse can die the old fashioned way, by getting struck by lightning
1/22/18, 12:54 PM - Miles Gilbert: lol
1/22/18, 12:55 PM - Miles Gilbert: ok... but, since our ethos is that BOTW is a game best played the way an individual chooses to play it, could ege's way of playing include asking his friends how to play it?
1/22/18, 12:55 PM - Miles Gilbert: ~expanding universe brain~

1/25/18, 9:00 PM - Adam Polonski: Me too my USB C is all I need
1/26/18, 7:07 AM - Miles Gilbert: Monster Hunter reviews (re: grinding)

The Monster Hunter franchise is known to rebuff new players. Liking Monster Hunter, in some player’s minds, is a special dedication, akin to liking cross-country skiing or watching the entire Cremaster Cycle in one weekend. You admire the folks that do it, but you also suspect they might be unrelenting masochists.

In this capacity, Monster Hunter: World, a game designed to be more inviting than its predecessors, is, for a lot of folks, the first modern incarnation of a franchise they’ve long been tantalized with but overwhelmed by. As someone from that group, I’m here to declare that Capcom has achieved its goal.
1/26/18, 10:49 AM - William Welles: Damn. But no switch version!
1/26/18, 10:50 AM - Miles Gilbert: lol i know
1/26/18, 10:50 AM - Miles Gilbert: still think im gonna get it

1/26/18, 9:35 PM - Michael Lindsay: Either way mebe
1/26/18, 9:40 PM - Michael Lindsay: There's armor to b gotten
1/26/18, 9:40 PM - Ege Soyuer: Where’s that fire armor dawg
1/26/18, 9:41 PM - Michael Lindsay: Maybe some guy needs some help catching lizards?
1/27/18, 9:31 AM - DL Tashjian: Lolol so many different ways to approach
1/27/18, 2:18 PM - Ege Soyuer: Do I get to choose when the 🐘 healing power happens? Seems to happen at random times when I don’t need it. Am I pressing the wrong button?
1/27/18, 2:23 PM - Miles Gilbert: It happens when you're about to die if I remember correctly. It feels random but it's usually when a strong monster would have crushed u in one hit
1/27/18, 3:47 PM - Adam Polonski: I think it happens when you would have died otherwise? Basically a free fairy. But takes like 30m to recharge
1/27/18, 6:15 PM - Miles Gilbert: <Media omitted>

2/9/18, 7:08 PM - Ege Soyuer: It’s an illusion that arises when I try to be extremely present in the Moment

2/22/18, 9:50 AM - Miles Gilbert: so hard
2/22/18, 9:50 AM - Miles Gilbert: hardest boss
2/22/18, 9:50 AM - Ege Soyuer: I stopped playing for a while tho bc gaming def affects my mental health
2/22/18, 9:50 AM - Ege Soyuer: If I get sucked in for a long session. The next couple of days I’m a lil scrambled ege
2/22/18, 9:52 AM - Miles Gilbert: i feel u
2/22/18, 9:52 AM - Miles Gilbert: what feelings do u feel after the long session
2/22/18, 9:53 AM - Miles Gilbert: just realizing i responded with 'i feel u' but maybe the feelings i have after a long session are different than yours
2/22/18, 9:53 AM - Ege Soyuer: That’s cool I get what you mean
2/22/18, 9:54 AM - Adam Polonski: i feel u too w the same caveat
2/22/18, 9:54 AM - Ege Soyuer: Umm so I’ve been noticing i need a lot of willpower to get thru my day without getting depressed/overeating
2/22/18, 9:54 AM - Ege Soyuer: And gaming fries my willpower
2/22/18, 9:54 AM - Ege Soyuer: So I just kinda move through life as a powerless blob
2/22/18, 9:54 AM - Ege Soyuer: Until I can recharge willpower thru exercise/meditation/good food
2/22/18, 9:56 AM - Ege Soyuer: That’s just me tho I’m pretty sensitive
2/22/18, 9:56 AM - DL Tashjian: If only you could work on your pecks while gaming
2/22/18, 9:56 AM - DL Tashjian: a girl i work with yesterday told me it's all about that upper chest look
2/22/18, 9:57 AM - Ege Soyuer: I actually notice that with all screen activity
2/22/18, 9:57 AM - Ege Soyuer: Including movies tv internet phone
2/22/18, 9:57 AM - Ege Soyuer: It just disconnects me from ability to control my attention
2/22/18, 9:59 AM - Ege Soyuer: How do you guys feel after too many video gaymes
2/22/18, 10:00 AM - DL Tashjian: Usually like i need to go outside
2/22/18, 10:00 AM - DL Tashjian: or sleep
2/22/18, 10:00 AM - DL Tashjian: depending on when where im playing
2/22/18, 10:00 AM - DL Tashjian: usually if i get done with a long sesh i'm getting off a plane
2/22/18, 10:00 AM - DL Tashjian: or im in my bed before sleep (which is bad bc it messes with your sleep)
2/22/18, 10:02 AM - Miles Gilbert: all the other things I could have gotten done during the session come flooding into my head and i get depressed that i didn't do them
2/22/18, 10:03 AM - Miles Gilbert: the only time that doesnt happen is if im playing on the plane or while yolanda is sleeping on top of my on the couch 😂.. which is why i love the switch so much
2/22/18, 10:03 AM - Miles Gilbert: i've started setting alarms for like 45mins to an 90 mins for my sessions
2/22/18, 10:04 AM - DL Tashjian: Its tough to keep a zelda sesh under and hour
2/22/18, 10:04 AM - Miles Gilbert: cuz like.. im satisfied after that amount of time, but if i don't set an alarm then i'll just keep playing
2/22/18, 10:04 AM - DL Tashjian: Unless I'm just doing a quick forage or traveling to kill some enemies and grab some good weapons after a blood moon
2/22/18, 10:05 AM - DL Tashjian: Dayum miles after we talked about the colosseum i did a run and it's so fun i gotta go back after the blood moon
2/22/18, 10:05 AM - DL Tashjian: I
2/22/18, 10:05 AM - DL Tashjian: I've done top to bottom and now bottom to top
2/22/18, 10:06 AM - Adam Polonski: Miles it's nice to hear you say that because I feel exactly the same way and it makes me crazy sometimes especially after a loooong strategy game session
2/22/18, 10:11 AM - William Welles: The big strategy games are my fav games but I also have to be super careful w them. Can literally burn 20 hours in a row and barely notice. My control is like do a binge 4-5 times a year and just go super hard one weekend then not even turn it on for months
2/22/18, 10:16 AM - Miles Gilbert: yea, monster hunter was like that for me... thankfully it dropped during my funemployment... havent touched it since then
2/22/18, 10:16 AM - Miles Gilbert: and have no desire to
2/22/18, 10:17 AM - Miles Gilbert: oh.. the shadow of the colossus reboot is TYTE
2/22/18, 10:17 AM - Miles Gilbert: its so beautiful
2/22/18, 10:17 AM - DL Tashjian: Oh shit if they had shadow of the colossus for switch it'd be game over for me
2/22/18, 10:17 AM - Miles Gilbert: yea for sure
2/22/18, 10:17 AM - DL Tashjian: i'd have to throw it away
2/22/18, 10:18 AM - Ege Soyuer: Ohhh is the point of blood moons to restock weapons?
2/22/18, 10:18 AM - Ege Soyuer: That makes cents I’m like why am I watching this cutscene
2/22/18, 10:18 AM - Ege Soyuer: Do u guys use the lil weapon markers to mark where good weaps are and re-get after BMs(blood moons)
2/22/18, 10:21 AM - William Welles: Yeah restock weps but you can skip cutscene. I never did that but it’s a pretty good idea 💡
2/22/18, 10:21 AM - Miles Gilbert: guys... i have a question about blood moons
2/22/18, 10:22 AM - Miles Gilbert: like... what are they
2/22/18, 10:22 AM - Miles Gilbert: cuz they never affected me
2/22/18, 10:22 AM - William Welles: Once I got strong enough to farm weak lynols I stocked up on some solid weps to get me through the hard times
2/22/18, 10:22 AM - DL Tashjian: Lol
2/22/18, 10:22 AM - William Welles: All the mons you killed come back to life
2/22/18, 10:22 AM - DL Tashjian: They respawn all the mons
2/22/18, 10:22 AM - Miles Gilbert: oh i thought they made all mons invincible
2/22/18, 10:22 AM - DL Tashjian: Every blood moon i run a lynel gauntlet to load up
2/22/18, 10:23 AM - Miles Gilbert: i guess being a pacifist paid off
2/22/18, 10:23 AM - DL Tashjian: But first i forage me some hearty radishes and durians
2/22/18, 10:23 AM - William Welles: The annoying thing they do is if you wait on a cliff all night waiting to hunt a dragon then blood moon pops and it disappears which is so stupid and makes no sense
2/22/18, 10:23 AM - Miles Gilbert: every blood moon for me is literally a walk in the park
2/22/18, 10:23 AM - DL Tashjian: blood moon has ruined some serious occasions for me
2/22/18, 10:24 AM - DL Tashjian: Like when you slay an entire enemy camp and then you gotta run away
2/22/18, 10:24 AM - Ege Soyuer: Woah. You can fight those dragons??
2/22/18, 10:24 AM - Ege Soyuer: They’re so high up how do you even reach them

2/22/18, 10:25 AM - Ege Soyuer: Also so peaceful
2/22/18, 10:25 AM - DL Tashjian: Ege if you get close enough to a dragon they turn into yiga clan members
2/22/18, 10:25 AM - DL Tashjian: And they throw bananas at you
2/22/18, 10:25 AM - Ege Soyuer: Why would you fight them they’re so chill
2/22/18, 10:25 AM - Ege Soyuer: (The dragons)
2/22/18, 10:26 AM - Ege Soyuer: Yiga clan has no chill like I’m just trying to have a conversation w this lonely human out in the big world
2/22/18, 10:26 AM - DL Tashjian: hahahaha
2/22/18, 10:26 AM - Adam Polonski: First time I met a yiga at about 4am the first night I had the game I freaked the fuck out
